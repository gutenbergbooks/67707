<h3 id='ch5.7' class='c012'>CHAPTER VII. <br /> SLAVES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>It will have been remarked, that both in town
and country, the mean and painful drudgery was
chiefly performed by slaves,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> whose origin, condition,
and numbers, in the principal Grecian states,
it now becomes necessary to describe. The greatest
writers of antiquity<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a> were on this subject perplexed
and undecided. They appear to have comprehended
the full extent of the evil,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a> but to have been
too much the slaves themselves of habit and prejudice
to discover, that no form or modification of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>servitude is consistent with human happiness or
with justice, without which no happiness can be.
This is evident from the conversation in Crete between
Plato and his Gnosian and Spartan companions.
They do not trouble their minds with inquiries
respecting the origin of slavery, which,
while some tribes of men are stronger and more
civilised than others, could never be difficult to be
conjectured; but considering its existence easy to
be accounted for, they are concerned to discover
by what means may be avoided or mitigated the
mischiefs they everywhere saw accompanying it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most perplexing of all,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> however, was the Laconian
Heloteia; because in that case the comparatively
great number of the servile caste rendered
it necessary, in the opinion of some, to break their
spirit and bring them down to their condition by
a system of severity which constitutes the infamy
of Sparta.</p>

<p class='c001'>The discredit, however, of subsisting on slave labour
was to a certain extent shared by all the
states of Greece, even by Athens. They appear
to have supposed that no slaves, no body politic.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
But in the treatment of those unfortunate men
there was as much variation as from the differences
of national character might have been inferred.
The Athenians in this respect, as in most
others, being the antipodes of the Spartans, and
falling into the error, if such a thing can be conceived,
of extreme humanity and indulgence.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is no doubt possible by kindness to obliterate
many of the ugly features of slavery, so that between
the vassal and his lord strong mutual affection
may spring up.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a> We hear, accordingly, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>slaves whose love for their masters exceeded the
love of brothers, or of children;<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> they have toiled,
fought, died, for them; nay they have sometimes
surpassed them in courage, and taught them, in
situations of imminent danger, how to die, as in
the case of that military attendant, who, when
taken prisoner with his master, and seeing him resolved
on death, yet hesitating about the means,
dashed his brains out against the wall to show him
how it might be done. Another example is recorded
of a slave who put on the disguise of his lord,
that he might be slain in his stead. But what
then? Do these examples prove that in servitude
there is anything ennobling? On the contrary, the
only inference to be drawn from them is, that in
these cases great and worthy souls had been dealt
with unjustly by fortune. However, since none but
the incorrigibly base can now be found to advocate
this worst of all human vices, I may spare my arguments,
and proceed at once to trace the history
of slavery in Greece.</p>

<p class='c001'>In very remote ages mankind, according to tradition,
dispensed with the labours of domestic slaves,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>whose place was supplied by the women of the family,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
who rose before day to grind corn for the household;
and as they usually sang while thus engaged,
the whole village on such occasions would seem alive
with music. As in the East, also, they were accustomed
to draw water from the wells, or seek it at
a distance at the fountains, as I have already, in
speaking of the Hellenic women, observed. But as
soon as men began to give quarter in war, and became
possessed of prisoners, the idea of employing
them, and rendering their labours subservient to
their maintenance naturally suggested itself. At
the outset, therefore, as a very distinguished historian<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
has remarked, servitude sprung from feelings
of humanity; for when it was found that advantages
could be derived from captured enemies
they were no longer butchered in the field. Hence,
from the verb signifying “to be subdued,” they
were denominated Dmöes;<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a> for “of whom a man is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
Of these constant mention is made in Homer. Thus
Telemachos speaks of the Dmöes whom his father
had left in his charge; and Agamemnon detained
in his tent a number of Lesbian women taken captive
in war. In the same condition was Briseïs:
and to this fate Hector fears Andromache may be
reserved after his death.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Possibly the practice was borrowed from the East,
where the mention of slaves occurs in the remotest
ages. Thus too in later times, Atossa, queen of
Persia, is represented to have urged Darius into the
Grecian war, that she might possess Athenian, Spartan,
Argive, and Corinthian slaves.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> And the Pythoness
foretelling the destruction of Miletus, exclaims:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“And of a numerous long-haired race thy wives shall wash the
feet.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The practice was when a number of prisoners had
been taken, to make a division of them among the
chiefs, generally by lot, and then to sell them for
slaves.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a> This Achilles boasts he had frequently done,
and old Priam fears will be the destiny of his own
sons, as it had been of Lycaon whom the Thessalian
hero had seized<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a> in his garden. To the same purpose
is the lament of Hecuba,<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> who accuses him of
having reduced many of her sons to slavery. Examples
occur in antiquity of whole cities and states
being at once subjected to servitude: thus the inhabitants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of Judea were a first and a second time
carried away captive to Babylon, where their masters,
not perhaps from mockery, required of them to
sing for their entertainment some of their national
songs, to which, as we learn from the prophet, they
replied: “How can we sing the songs of Zion in a
strange land?” The citizens likewise of Miletos,
after the unsuccessful revolt of Aristagoras, were
transported into Persia, as were those also of Eretria
and Carystos in Eubœa.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Like the Israelites,
these Greeks long preserved in captivity their national
manners and language, though surrounded by
strangers and urged by every inducement to assimilate
themselves to their conquerors. A similar fate
overtook the inhabitants of Thebes, who were sold
into slavery by Alexander, as were those of Mycene
by the Argives, and the Corinthians by Mummius.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the supply produced by war seldom equalled
the demand; and in consequence a race of kidnappers
sprung up, who, partly merchants and partly
pirates, roamed about the shores of the Mediterranean,
as similar miscreants do now about the slave-coasts,
picking up solitary and unprotected individuals.
Sometimes their boldness rose to the wives or daughters
of the chiefs; as in the case of Paris, who robbed
the house, and carried away the wife of Menelaus;
and of those Phœnicians who having landed at Argos
and held, during several days, a fair on the beach,
ended by stealing the king’s daughter.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Mitford’s
supposition that both Io and her companions may
have been allured on board,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a> is founded on the apologetical
narrative of the pirates themselves. The
practice of kidnapping certainly prevailed widely.
Thus Eumæos was, by the Phœnicians, sold to
Laertes, and a similar fate awaited the woman
whom the Taphian pirates stole away at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>time.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a> Odysseus himself relates how a Phœnician
rogue plotted against his liberty when he was sailing
with him towards Libya, and that the Thesprotians
had meditated a like design.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a> To enumerate no
other instances, Laomedon menaces Apollo and Poseidon
with servitude, observing that he will have
them bound and shipped to some distant island for
sale.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Neither war, however, nor piracy sufficed at length
to furnish that vast multitude of slaves, which the
growing luxury of the times induced the Greeks to
consider necessary. Commerce by degrees conducted
them to Caria and other parts of Asia Minor, particularly
the southern coasts of the Black Sea, those
great nurseries of slaves from that time until now.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
The first Greeks who engaged in this traffic, which
even by the Pagans was supposed to be attended by
a curse, are said to have been the Chians, and we
shall presently see how ill it prospered with them.
They purchased their slaves from the barbarians,
among whom the Lydians, the Phrygians, and the
natives of Pontos, with many others were accustomed,
like the modern Circassians, to carry on a
trade in their own people.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a> We find mention made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>in the Anabasis of a Macronian, who having been a
slave at Athens and obtaining his liberty, afterwards
became a soldier and served the Ten Thousand as
an interpreter at a critical moment during their passage
through his native country.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Before proceeding, however, with the history of the
slave-trade, it may be proper to describe the power
possessed by masters over their domestics during
the heroic ages. Every man appears to have been
then a king in his own house, and to have exercised
his authority most regally. Thus we find the young
Telemachos taking pleasure in the idea that he shall
be king over his slaves;<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a> and Andromache, with a
mother’s fondness, fears lest her son should become
the drudge of an unfeeling lord.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a> Power generally,
when unchecked by law, is fierce and inhuman, and
over their household, gentlemen, in those ages, exercised
the greatest and most awful power, that of
life and death, as they afterwards did at Rome.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
This is illustrated by an example in the Odyssey,
where the hero being, while in disguise, insulted
grossly by Melanthios, threatens the slave that he
will incite Telemachos to cut him in pieces. Afterwards,
when he has recovered his authority, the
terrible menace is remembered and fulfilled. The
culprit is seized and mutilated with savage barbarity,
his members, torn from the body, are thrown to the
dogs, and even the poet, upon the whole so humane,
does not seem to consider the punishment too great
for the offence.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a> It has even been supposed that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>this kind of mutilation was a punishment peculiar
to slaves; for Laomedon, while menacing the gods
in the manner above described, adds, that he will
cut off their ears.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a> When supposed to deserve death
they were executed ignominiously by hanging, as in
the case of the domestics of Odysseus, whose offences,
though grave, would scarcely in any free country be
visited with capital punishment.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a> This was regarded
as an impure end. To die honourably was to perish
by the sword.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The practice of manumission already in the heroic
ages prevailed.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Odysseus promises their freedom to
his herdsman and swineherd if by their aid he should
slaughter the suitors; and, according to Plutarch,
Telemachos actually bestowed on Eumæos and his
companions both their liberty and the rights of
citizenship, and from them, he adds, the celebrated
families of the Koliades and Bukoli were
descended.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Nor does the illustrious race appear to be yet extinct,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Professor Koliades<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a> claiming to be a lineal
descendant from Eumæos, which may very well be
since he must be descended from somebody; and
there is no reason why a descendant of Eumæos
should not be a professor.</p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to the slaves there were likewise free
labourers who worked for hire, and were called
Thetes.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a> These sometimes seem to have been placed
on the extremities of estates, as the guardians of
boundaries, a post which Eurymachos offers with
good wages to Odysseus.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> And it is the condition
of one of these hinds that Achilles prefers in Hades
to the empire of the shades.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a> The gods also in
their sojourn upon earth sometimes submitted to the
hardships of this condition. Thus Phœbos Apollo
kept the flocks of Admetos, king of Thessaly,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a> and
the belief in this humble condition of the gods on
earth is objected by Lucian and Dionysius of Halicarnassus,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
as blameworthy to the Greeks. Herodotus,
too, relates that the three sons of Temenos—Gavanes,
Aëropos, and Perdiccas—fled from Argos
into Illyria and thence into Upper Macedonia to
the city of Lebæa, where they served the king for
hire, the first tending the royal stud, the second
the cattle, and the third the sheep and goats.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From the history of Minos, which, whether true
or fabulous, still illustrates the manners of the times,
we learn, that the tribute exacted by a victorious
enemy sometimes consisted of slaves. Thus the Cretan
king, having made a successful descent on the
Attic coast, was propitiated (as by our own ancestors
were the Danes and other Northern savages)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>by an annual offering of fourteen youths and virgins,
who, being conveyed to Crete, were there said to
be destroyed by a monster born of Pasiphaë, daughter
of the sun.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a> Theseus, the great hero of the Ionic
race, delivered his country from this obnoxious tax,
and on his return to Athens was received by the
people with unbounded gratitude; sacrifices and
processions were instituted in his honour, and the
memory of his noble achievement was religiously preserved
as long as paganism endured.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>And in some such ways as the above, slaves, in
early times, must have been procured; for, as Timæos
of Taormina<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a> remarks, the Greeks of those ages
obtained none in the regular course of traffic. He
further adds, that Aristotle was generally accused of
having misunderstood the usages of the Locrians,
among whom, as among the Phocians,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a> it was not
of old the custom to possess slaves, whether male or
female. The practice, however, prevailed in later
times; and the wife of that Philomelos who took
Delphi is said to have been the first who was attended
by two servile handmaids.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a> But when men commence
evil courses, they seldom know where to stop.
Mnason, a Phocian, and friend of Aristotle,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a> ambitious
of rivalling Nicias, the son of Niceratos,
purchased for his own service a thousand slaves, for
which he was accused by his countrymen of lavishing
upon them what would have supported an equal
number of free persons.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a> In that country, therefore,
it is clear there existed a class of labourers like
the Thetes described by Homer, who were ready to
work for hire.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a> In their domestic economy the simplicity
of their manners enabled the Phocians and
Locrians to dispense with the services of slaves, it
being the custom among them, as among the rustics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of Eubœa, whom we have described above, for the
younger members of the family to wait on the elder.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Chians, as I have already observed, are said
to have been the first Grecian people who engaged
in a regular slave-trade.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a> For, although the Thessalians
and Spartans possessed, at a period much
anterior, their Penestæ and their Helots, they obtained
them by different means: the latter, by reducing
to subjection the ancient Achæan inhabitants
of Peloponnesos;<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a> the former, by their conquests
over the Magnesians, Perrhæbians, and Bœotians of
Arnè. But the Chians possessed only such barbarian
slaves as they had purchased with money, in which
they more nearly resembled the slave-holding nations
of modern times.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Other circumstances, likewise, in
the history of slavery among the Chians,<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a> strongly
suggest the parallel, and deserve to be studied with
more care than appears to have been bestowed upon
them. We have here, perhaps, the first type of the
Maroon wars, though on a smaller scale, and marked
by fewer outbreaks of atrocity. It is not, indeed,
stated that the females were flogged, though throughout
Greece the males were so corrected; but, whatever
the nature of the severities practised on them
may have been,<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a> the yoke of bondage was found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>too galling to be borne,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a> and whole gangs took refuge
in the mountains. Fortunately for them, the interior
of the island abounded in fastnesses, and was, in those
days, covered with forest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, therefore, the fugitives, erecting themselves
dwellings, or taking possession of caverns among
almost inaccessible cliffs, successfully defended themselves,
subsisting on the plunder of their former
owners. Shortly before the time of the writer, to
whom we are indebted for these details, a bondsman,
named Drimacos, made his escape from the
city and reached the mountains, where, by valour and
conduct, he soon placed himself at the head of the
servile insurgents over whom he ruled like a king.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
The Chians led several expeditions against him in
vain. He defeated them in the field with great
slaughter; but, at length, to spare the useless effusion
of human blood, invited them to a conference,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>wherein he observed, that the slaves, being encouraged
in their revolt by an oracle, would never lay
down their arms or submit to the drudgery of servitude.
Nevertheless, the war might be terminated.
“For, if my advice,” said he, “be followed, and we be
suffered to enjoy tranquillity, numerous advantages
will thence accrue to the state.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There being little prospect of a satisfactory settlement
of the matter by arms, the Chians consented
to enter into a truce as with a public enemy.
Humbled by their losses and defeats, Drimacos
found them submissive to reason. He, therefore,
provided himself with weights, measures, and
a signet,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a> and exhibiting them to his former masters,
said, “When, in future, our necessities require that
I should supply myself from your stores, it shall
always be by these weights and measures, and
having possessed myself of the necessary quantity of
provisions, I shall be careful to leave your warehouses
sealed with this signet. With respect to
such of your slaves as may fly and offer themselves
to me, I will institute a rigid examination
into their story, and if, upon inquiry, they appear
to have had just grounds for complaint, I
will protect them—if not, they shall be sent back
to their proprietors.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To these conditions the magistrates readily acceded,
upon which the slaves who still remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>with their masters grew more obedient, and seldom
took to flight, dreading the decision of Drimacos.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a>
Over his own followers he exercised a despotic
authority. They, in fact, stood far more in fear of
him than when in bondage of their lords, and performed
his bidding without question or murmur, as
soldiers obey their commander. For he was severe
in the punishment of the unruly, and permitted no
man to plunder or lay waste the country, or commit
any act of injustice,—in short, to do anything
without his order. The public festivals he was careful
to observe, going round and collecting from the
proprietors of the land, who bestowed upon him voluntarily
both wine and the finest victims; but if, on
these occasions, he discovered that a plot was hatching,
or any ambush laid for him, he would take
speedy vengeance.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far the affairs of the Chians and their revolted
bondsmen proceeded smoothly. But things continued
not always on this footing. Observing old
age to be creeping upon Drimacos, and rendered
wanton apparently by prosperity, the government
issued a proclamation, offering a great reward to
any one who should capture him, or bring them his
head.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a> The old general, discerning, perhaps, signals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of treachery, or convinced that, at last, it must come
to that, took aside a young man whom he loved,
and said, “I have ever regarded you with a stronger
affection than any other man, and to me you have
been, instead of a son, a brother, and every other
tie. But now, the days of my life are at an end,
nor would I have them prolonged. With you,
however, it is not so. Youth and the bloom of
youth are yours. What then is to be done? You
must prove yourself to possess valour and greatness
of soul; and since the state offers riches and
freedom to whomsoever shall slay me and bear
them my head, let the reward be yours. Strike
it off, and be happy!”</p>

<p class='c001'>At first the youth rejected the proposal, but ultimately
Drimacos prevailed. The old man fell, and
his friend on presenting his head received the sum
which had been offered by the state, together with
his freedom, and thereupon after burying his benefactor’s
remains, he sailed away to his own country.
Now, however, the Chians underwent the
just punishment of their treachery. No longer
guided by the wisdom and authority of Drimacos,
the fugitive slaves returned to their original habits
of plunder and devastation; whereupon, remembering
the moderation of the dead, they erected an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Heroön upon his grave, and denominated him the
propitious hero. The insurgents, too, holding his
memory in no less veneration, continued for ages
to offer up the first-fruits of their spoil at his
tomb. He was, in fact, honoured with a kind of
apotheosis, and canonized among the gods of the
island; for it was believed that his shade often appeared
to men in dreams for the purpose of revealing
some servile conspiracy while yet in the
bud: and they to whom he vouchsafed these warning
visits, more grateful than when he yet lived,
never failed to proceed to his chapel, and offer sacrifice
to his manes.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In another department of iniquity the Chians
would appear to have been engaged about the period
of Xerxes’ expedition into Greece; I mean
the making of eunuchs for the Eastern market.
Panionios, a miscreant engaged in this traffic, who
had mutilated and sold into slavery a young man
named Hermotimos, at length expiated his offence
against human nature by being himself, together
with his four sons, subjected to the same operation.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a>
His countrymen, also, in process of time,
were, in like manner, compelled to drain the bitter
cup of servitude. For, as we find recorded by Nicolaos
the Peripatetic, and Posidonios the Stoic,
having been subjugated by Mithridates of Cappadocia,
they were delivered up to their own slaves
to be carried away captive into Colchis, which Athenæus,
a man not overburdened with religion, considers
the just punishment of their wickedness in
having been the first who introduced the slave-trade
into Greece, when they might have been better
served by freemen for hire. From this ancient villany
of the Chians is supposed to have arisen the
proverb—“the Chian has bought himself a master,”
which Eupolis introduced into his drama
called the “Friends.”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c014'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>The servile war which took place among the Samians,
had a more fortunate issue, though but few
particulars respecting it have come down to us. It
was related, however, by Malacos, in his annals of
the Siphnians, that Ephesos was first founded by
a number of Samian slaves, who having retired to a
mountain on the island to the number of a thousand,
inflicted numerous evils on their former tyrants.
These in the sixth year of the war, having consulted
the oracle, came to an understanding with their
slaves, who being permitted to depart in safety from
the island, sailed away, and became the founders of
the city and people of Ephesos.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c014'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In Attica, the institution of slavery,<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a> though attended,
as it everywhere must be, by innumerable
evils, nevertheless exhibited itself under the mildest
form which it anywhere assumed in the ancient
world.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a> With their characteristic attention to the
interests of humanity, the Athenians enacted a law,
in virtue of which slaves could indict their masters
for assault and battery. Hyperides, accordingly, observed
in his oration against Mantitheos, “our laws
making no distinction in this respect between freemen
and slaves, grant to all alike the privilege of
bringing an action against those who insult or injure
them.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c014'><sup>[70]</sup></a> To the same effect spoke Lycurgus<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c014'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
in his first oration against Lycophron; but Demosthenes
has preserved the law which empowered any
Athenian, not labouring under legal disability, to denounce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>to the Thesmothetæ the person who offered
violence to man, woman, or boy, whether slave or
free. The action was tried before the court of Heliæa,
and numerous were the examples of men who
had suffered death for crimes committed against
bondsmen. Not, therefore, without reason did the
orator eulogise the humane spirit of the law, or
dwell upon the beneficial effects which a knowledge
of its existence must produce among those
barbarous nations who furnished Greece with servile
labourers.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a> Another privilege enjoyed by the
slave class in Attica was that of purchasing their
own freedom, as often as, by the careful management
of the peculium secured them by law, they
were enabled to offer to their owners an equivalent
for their services.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Still, even in Attica, the yoke of bondage was
a heavy yoke, the law itself, in other matters, drawing
distinctions between freemen and slaves doubly
galling because palpably unnecessary. Legally, for
example, they were not allowed to wear long hair,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
or a garment with two sleeves,<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a> to drink wine, save
at the festival of Pithœgia on the first day of the
month Anthesterion; to anoint themselves as in the
gymnasia, to be present at the procession in honour
of the Eumenides, or in the case of females to enter
the temple of Demeter during the celebration of
the Thesmophoria.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a> A similar spirit pervaded the
servile code in other parts of Greece. Thus, in the
island of Cos they were prohibited from joining in
the sacrifices to Hera, and from tasting the victims.
They were, likewise, forbidden to be present when
offerings were presented to the Manes of Phorbas.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>But from the very words of the law which authorised
the temple wardens to exclude them on these
occasions, it is clear that on all others they might
freely enter.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a> At Athens, with the exceptions above
mentioned, every temple in the city appears to have
been open to them. Occasionally, moreover, certain
of their number were selected to accompany their
masters to consult the oracle at Delphi, when even
they were permitted, like free citizens, to wear
crowns upon their heads, which, for the time conferred
upon them exemption from blows or stripes.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a>
Among their more serious grievances, was their liability
to personal chastisement, which, besides being
inflicted as our punishment of the treadmill, or whipping,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c014'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
at the carts’-tail, by an order of the magistrates,<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c014'><sup>[80]</sup></a>
was too much left to the discretion of their
owners, whose mercies in many cases would be none
of the most tender. In time of war, however, this
planter’s luxury could not be enjoyed,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a> since the
flogged slaves might go over to the enemy, as sometimes
happened.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a> They are said, besides, to have
worked the mines in fetters; probably, however,
only in consequence of the revolt described by Posidonios,
in which they slew the overseers of the
mines, and taking possession of the acropolis of Sunium,<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
laid waste for a considerable time the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of the adjacent districts. This took place simultaneously
with the second insurrection of the slaves
in Sicily (there was, perhaps, an understanding between
them) in the quelling of which nearly a million
of their number were destroyed.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a> Other grievances
they endured, which will be noticed as we proceed;
but in addition to those that actually existed,
a learned modern writer has imagined another,
which, in his opinion, reduces their condition beneath
that of the Helots. “Nearly all the ties of
family were broken,” he says, “among the slaves
of Athens;” and further explaining himself in a
note remarks, that the marriage of slaves was there
an uncommon event.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c014'><sup>[85]</sup></a> We find, however, from contemporary
writers, that except in cases of incorrigible
perverseness, slaves were, on the contrary, encouraged
to marry, it being supposed they would
thus become more attached to their masters.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c014'><sup>[86]</sup></a> The
same bold and ingenious writer endeavours to give
a reason for what has been quoted above, by saying,
“it was cheaper to purchase than to bring up
slaves.” This was not the opinion of the ancients,
“we,” say they, “prefer and put more trust in slaves
born and brought up in the house, than in such
as are purchased.”<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c014'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It has been observed that, from the most grievous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>insults and contumely, slaves were protected by the
laws; but if, in spite of legal protection, their masters
found means to render their lives a burden,
the state provided them with an asylum in the
temples of Theseus and the Eumenides.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c014'><sup>[88]</sup></a> Having
there taken sanctuary, their oppressors could not
force them thence without incurring the guilt of
sacrilege.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c014'><sup>[89]</sup></a> Thus, in a fragment of Aristophanes’
Seasons we find a slave deliberating whether he
should not take refuge in the Theseion, and there
remain till he could procure his transfer to a new
master;<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c014'><sup>[90]</sup></a> for any one who conducted himself too
harshly towards his slaves was by law compelled
to sell them.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c014'><sup>[91]</sup></a> Nay and not only so, but the slave
could institute an action against his lord called
αἰκιάς δίκη, or against any other citizen who had
behaved unjustly or injuriously towards him. But
the right of sanctuary was no doubt limited, and
only extended from the time of the slave’s flight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to the next New Moon, when a periodical slave-auction
appears to have been held.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c014'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On this occasion the slaves were stationed, as I
have seen them in the bazaars of modern Egypt,
in a circle in the market-place, and the one whose
turn it was to be sold mounted a table, which seems
to have been of stone, where he exhibited himself
and was knocked down to the best bidder. Sometimes
when the articles were lively they made great
sport for the company, as in the case of Diogenes
who bawled aloud “whoever among you wants a
master, let him buy me.”<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c014'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To the friskiness whether natural or assumed which
the young barbarians often exhibited on this occasion,
Menander alludes in the following fragment
of his Ephesian:<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c014'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I scorn by the gods to be breechesless found,</div>
      <div class='line'>And for sale tripping briskly the vile circles round.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Slaves of little or no value were contemptuously
called “salt-bought,” from a custom prevalent among
the inland Thracians, of bartering their captives for
salt;<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c014'><sup>[95]</sup></a> whence it may be inferred, that domestics
from that part of the world were considered inferior.</p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting the price of slaves an important passage
occurs in the Memorabilia, where Socrates, conversing
with Antisthenes, on the subject of friendship, inquires
whether friends were to be valued at so much
per head, like slaves, some of whom he says were
not worth a demimina, while others would fetch two,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>five, or even ten minæ,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c014'><sup>[96]</sup></a> that is, the price varied
from forty shillings to forty pounds. Nay it is even
said that Nicias, son of Niceratos, bought an overseer
for his silver mines at the price of a talent, or
two hundred and forty-one pounds sterling.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c014'><sup>[97]</sup></a> This
passage is in substance quoted by Boeckh,<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c014'><sup>[98]</sup></a> who observes
that, exclusively of the fluctuations caused by
the variations in the supply and the demand, the
market-price of slaves was affected by their age,
health, strength, beauty, natural abilities, mechanical
ingenuity, and moral qualities. The meanest and
cheapest class were those who worked in the mills,<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c014'><sup>[99]</sup></a>
where mere bodily strength was required, and therefore
by setting Samson at this labour the Philistines
intimated their extreme contempt for his blind
energy. A very low value was set upon such slaves
as worked in the mines, about 150 drachmas in the
age of Demosthenes.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c014'><sup>[100]</sup></a> Ordinary house-slaves, whether
male or female, might be valued at about the
same price. Demosthenes, in fact, considered two
minæ and a half a large sum for a person of this
class. Of the sword-cutlers possessed by the orator’s
father some were valued at six minæ, others at five,
while the lowest were worth above three. Chair-makers
sold for about two minæ.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>In his discussion on this point, Boeckh<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c014'><sup>[101]</sup></a> charges
Demosthenes with intentional falsehood, because, in
his oration against Aphobos, he reckons fourteen
sword-cutlers at forty minæ, something less than three
minæ a-piece. But among those possessed by his
father at his death some were reckoned at only
three minæ. His guardians made use of them for
ten years, that is, till they were grown old, by which
time the best would have deteriorated, and the others
become of no value.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c014'><sup>[102]</sup></a> This being the case, I do
not see upon what ground Boeckh bases his accusation.
The wages of slaves, when let out by their
masters on hire, varied greatly, as did also the profit
derived from them. A miner was supposed to yield
his master an obolos per day, a leather-worker two
oboli, and a foreman or overseer three. Expert
manufacturers of fine goods, such as head-nets, stuffs
of Amorgos, and variegated fabrics like our flowered
muslins, must have produced their owners much
greater returns.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c014'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Slaves, at Athens, were divided into two classes,
private and public. The latter, who were the property
of the state, performed several kinds of service
supposed to be unworthy of freemen: they
were, for example, employed as vergers, messengers,
apparitors, scribes, clerks of public works,<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c014'><sup>[104]</sup></a> and inferior
servants of the gods. Most of the temples
of Greece possessed, in fact, a great number of slaves
or serfs, who cultivated the sacred domains, exercised
various humbler offices of religion, and were,
in short, ready on all occasions to execute the orders
of the priests.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c014'><sup>[105]</sup></a> At Corinth, where the worship of
Aphrodite chiefly prevailed, these slaves consisted
almost exclusively of women,<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c014'><sup>[106]</sup></a> who having, on certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>occasions, burnt frankincense, and offered up
public prayers to the goddess, were sumptuously
feasted within the precincts of her fane.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the Athenians, the slaves of the republic,
generally captives taken in war, received a careful
education, and were sometimes entrusted with important
duties. Out of their number were selected
the secretaries,<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c014'><sup>[107]</sup></a> who, in time of war, accompanied
the generals and treasurers of the army, and made
exact minutes of their expenditure, in order that,
when on their return these officers should come to
render an account of their proceedings, their books
might be compared with those of the secretaries.
In cases of difficulty, moreover, these unfortunate
individuals were subjected to torture, in order to
obtain that kind of evidence which the ancients
deemed most satisfactory.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c014'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The servile vocabulary was necessarily abundant:
διάκονος,<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c014'><sup>[109]</sup></a> a servant in general; ὑπηρέτης,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c014'><sup>[110]</sup></a> a personal
attendant or valet; ἀργυρώ-νητης,<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c014'><sup>[111]</sup></a> a slave bought with
money; ὤνιος, the same; οἰκότριψ,<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c014'><sup>[112]</sup></a> οἰκοτραφὴς, a male
slave born in the house. The name given to the
female slave in the same condition was σηκὶς, or οἰκογενὴς.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c014'><sup>[113]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The housekeeper, likewise a slave, received
the appellation of ταμεία<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c014'><sup>[114]</sup></a> from her office. A lady’s
maid they called παιδίσκη,<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c014'><sup>[115]</sup></a> though it be doubtful,
according to Pollux, whether the orator Lysias, who
uses the word, does so with reference to the girl’s
youth or condition.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c014'><sup>[116]</sup></a> A slave born of slaves in the
house is called οἰκοτριβαίος.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c014'><sup>[117]</sup></a> Chrysippos makes a
distinction between οἰκέτης<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c014'><sup>[118]</sup></a> and δοῦλος,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c014'><sup>[119]</sup></a> but without
much foundation. Clitarchus enumerates various
names by which slaves were known in Greece: ἄζοι,
θεραπόντες,<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c014'><sup>[120]</sup></a> ἀκόλουθοι,<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c014'><sup>[121]</sup></a> πάλμονες, and λάτρεις. Rural
slaves were called ἐρκίται. Hermon, in his Cretan
Glossaries, observes, that slaves, born of free parents
(εὐγένεις), were, in the island of Crete, called μνῶται.
Seleucus informs us, that ἄζοι signifies servants male
and female.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c014'><sup>[122]</sup></a> The latter were also denominated ἀποφράσαι
and βολίζαι. A male slave, born of a slave,
was termed σινδρὼν; a female attendant on a lady,
ἀμφίπολος; a slave-girl who walked before her mistress,
πρόπολος. Female slaves were, at Lacedæmon,
called χαλκίδες. The term οἰκέτης was applied to any
person employed about a house, whether slave or free.</p>

<p class='c001'>A very pleasant and significant custom prevailed
when a slave newly purchased was first brought into
the house. They placed him before the hearth,
where his future master, mistress, and fellow-servants,
poured baskets of ripe fruit, dates, figs, filberts,
walnuts, and so on, upon his head, to intimate that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>he was come into the abode of plenty.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c014'><sup>[123]</sup></a> The occasion
was converted by his fellow-slaves into a
holiday and a feast; for custom appropriated to them
whatever was thus cast upon the new-comer, and as
there were sweetmeats among the rest, they had
wherewith to make merry.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c014'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Their food was commonly, as might be expected,
inferior to that of their masters. Thus the dates
grown in Greece, which ripened but imperfectly,
were appropriated to their use; and for their drink
they had a small thin wine called Lora,<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c014'><sup>[125]</sup></a> by the Romans
made of the husks of grapes, laid, after they
had been pressed, to soak in water,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c014'><sup>[126]</sup></a> and then squeezed
again, like our <em>Bunnel</em>, in the perry country.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c014'><sup>[127]</sup></a> That
they generally ate barley-bread in Attica was no
peculiar hardship,<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c014'><sup>[128]</sup></a> since the citizens themselves frequently
did the same. We find, moreover, that to
give a relish to their coarse meal, plain broth, and
salt fish,<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c014'><sup>[129]</sup></a> they were indulged with pickled gherkins.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>In the early ages of the commonwealth they imitated
the frugal manner of their lords, so that no
slave who valued his reputation would be seen to
enter a tavern; but in later times they naturally
shared largely in the general depravity of morals,
and placed their summum bonum in eating and
drinking. Their whole creed, on this point, has
been summed up in a few words by the poet Sotion.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c014'><sup>[130]</sup></a>
“Wherefore,” exclaims a slave, “dole forth these
absurdities, these ravings of sophists, prating up
and down the Lyceum, the Academy, and the
gates of the Odeion? In all these there is nothing
of value. Let us drink, let us drink deeply,
O Sicon, Sicon!<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c014'><sup>[131]</sup></a> Let us rejoice, whilst it is yet
permitted us to delight our souls. Enjoy thyself,
O Manes! Nothing is sweeter than the belly,
which alone is to thee as thy father and thy mother.
Virtues, embassies, generalships, are vain
pomps, resembling the plaudits of a dream. Heaven,
at the fated hour, will deliver thee to the
cold grasp of death, and thou wilt bear with thee
nothing but what thou hast drunk and eaten! All
else is dust, like Pericles, Codros, and Cimon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The employment of household slaves necessarily
varied according to the rank and condition of their
lords. In the dwellings of the wealthy and luxurious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>they were accustomed to fan their masters
and mistresses, and to drive away the flies with
branches of myrtle, instead of which, in the East,
they make use of flappers of palm-leaves. Among
the Roman ladies it was customary to retain a female
attendant for the sole purpose of looking after the
Melitensian lap-dogs<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c014'><sup>[132]</sup></a> of their mistresses, in which
they were less ambitious than that dame in Lucian,
who kept a philosopher for this purpose.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c014'><sup>[133]</sup></a> Female
cup-bearers filled the place of our saucy footmen.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c014'><sup>[134]</sup></a>
Ladies’ maids were likewise slaves. They were initiated
in all the arts of the toilette; and it is told
of Julia, whose hair turned prematurely grey, that
her ornatrix was sometimes surprised plucking out
the white hairs by the entrance of her father.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c014'><sup>[135]</sup></a> The
offices of these ornamenters is thus described by
Manilius:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Illis cura sui vultus frontisque decoræ</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Semper erit, tortosque in plexum ponere crineis,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aut nodis revocare, et rursus vertice denso</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fingere et appositis caput emutare capillis.</span><a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c014'><sup>[136]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In these arts they were regularly taught under
masters, and there would likewise appear to have
been a set of men who earned their subsistence by
initiating slaves in household labours. An example
is mentioned at Syracuse of a person<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c014'><sup>[137]</sup></a> who probably
had an establishment of his own, where he instructed
slaves in the whole round of their domestic
duties, such as bread-making, cooking, washing,
and so on. In the baker’s business Anaxarchos, an
Eudaimonist philosopher, one of the fitting companions
of Alexander the Great,<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c014'><sup>[138]</sup></a> introduced an improvement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>by which modern times may profit,—to
preserve his bread pure from the touch, and even
from the breath of the slaves who made it, he caused
them to knead the dough with gloves on their hands,
and to wear a respirator of some gauze-like substance
over the mouth.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c014'><sup>[139]</sup></a> Other individuals, who
grudged their domestics a taste of their delicacies,
obliged them, while employed at the kneading-trough,
to wear a broad collar, like a wheel, which
prevented them from bringing their hands to their
mouths.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c014'><sup>[140]</sup></a> This odious practice, however, could not
have been general, as it is clear, from an expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in Aristophanes<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c014'><sup>[141]</sup></a> and his scholiast, that slaves employed
in making bread used to amuse themselves
by eating the dough. This seems to be one of the
principal causes of disgust to the rogues in the
piece employed in preparing the delicacies with
which Trygæos feeds the beetle whereon he is
about to mount to the court of Zeus.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the city of Abdera, as we find from an anecdote
of Stratonicos,<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c014'><sup>[142]</sup></a> every private citizen kept a
slave who served him in the capacity of herald,
and announced by sound of trumpet the appearance
of the new moon, and the festival by which it was
followed. A <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bon mot</i></span> worth repeating is ascribed
to this travelling wit. Being one day in the cemetery
of Teicheios, a town of the Milesian territory,<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c014'><sup>[143]</sup></a>
inhabited by a mixed population from all the neighbouring
countries, and seeing on every tomb the
name of some foreigner, “Come,” said he to his
slave, “let us depart from this place. Nobody dies
here but strangers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most steady and faithful of the domestics
was usually selected to be the porter.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c014'><sup>[144]</sup></a> Occasionally,
moreover, in the establishments of opulent
and ostentatious persons, as Callias for example,
eunuchs, imported from Asia, were employed as door-keepers.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c014'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>The directions, as Mitford justly observes, which
Penelope’s housekeeper gives to the menial servants
for the business of the day, might still serve in the
East without variation: “Go quickly,” she said,
“some of you sweep the house, and sprinkle it,
and let the crimson carpets be spread upon the
seats; let all the tables be well rubbed with
sponges, and wash carefully the bowls and cups.
Some of you go immediately to the fountain for
water.”<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c014'><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Besides working at the mill, and fetching water,
both somewhat laborious employments, we find that
female slaves were sometimes engaged in offices still
more unfeminine; that is, in woodcutting upon the
mountains, where the impudent old fellow, in Aristophanes,
takes advantage of Thratta.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c014'><sup>[147]</sup></a> Events of
this kind, however, could only happen among the
peasant girls. In the city both mistresses and maids
were too domestic to meet with adventures in forest
or on mountains. Towards the decline of the commonwealth,
it became a mark of wealth and consequence
to be served by black domestics, both male
and female, as was also the fashion among the Romans
and the Egyptian Greeks. Thus Cleopatra<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c014'><sup>[148]</sup></a>
had negro boys for torch-bearers; and the shallow
exclusive, in Cicero,<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c014'><sup>[149]</sup></a> is anxious to make it known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that he has an African valet. Juvenal, in his sarcastic
style, alludes to this practice.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c014'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'>The Athenian ladies, like our Indian dames, affected
as a foil, perhaps, to be attended by waiting-maids
rendered “by Phœbus’ amorous pinches black.”<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c014'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Travellers among the higher Alps are almost invariably
attended by Swiss guides who, laden with
their employer’s baggage, climb before them up the
rocks, and are less fatigued at the close of the day’s
journey than the rich pedestrians who carry nothing
beyond their own weight. This is an exact
image of the style of travelling in antiquity. It was
then common even for opulent men, to “make their
own legs their compasses,” as Scriblerus phrases it;
but, not to load their own delicate shoulders with
a knapsack, they were attended, like Bacchos in the
Frogs, by a steady slave, who carried the baggage,
mounted on a porter’s knot upon his shoulders. To
employ more than one valet in this service was
esteemed a mark of luxurious habits; and therefore
Æschines reproaches Demosthenes that, during
his embassy, he was attended by two domestics with
each a carpet-bag.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c014'><sup>[152]</sup></a> Both by Theophrastus and
Xenophon this attendant is called an <em>Acoluthos</em>, or
follower, because it was his duty to walk behind his
master; but this name in general signified a youthful
valet, kept in personal attendance on the great.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c014'><sup>[153]</sup></a>
The simplicity of republican manners at Athens condemned
the habit of maintaining many of those
elegant youths, which, <a id='corr34.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='morever'>moreover</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_34.32'><ins class='correction' title='morever'>moreover</ins></a></span> was prohibited by
law.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c014'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>From the severity of manners, however, one evil
arose—the single slave was sometimes condemned
by vanity to carry the burden of two; and as their
grumblings were proportioned to their hardship, their
case was soon taken up by the comic poets, not, I
fear, so much for the sake of humanity, as because
it often furnished them with a good joke or two.
By degrees, as no writers dwell so constantly on a
fruitful topic or so frankly imitate each other, it
became the fashion of the stage to introduce a
miserable devil into every comedy, whose misfortunes,
like those of the clown in our pantomimes,
usually kept the theatre in a roar. The practice,
however, had already grown stale in the time of
Aristophanes, who both ridiculed and followed it;
for while his sneers at the grumbling valet are repeated
usque ad nauseam, much of the humour and
interest of the Frogs arise out of the tricks and
adventures of a melancholy wag of this description
as Casaubon<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c014'><sup>[155]</sup></a> long ago observed.</p>

<p class='c001'>When men have usurped an undue dominion over
their fellows, they seldom know where to stop. The
Syrians themselves, enslaved politically, and often
sold into servitude abroad, affected when rich a peculiarly
luxurious manner: female attendants waited
on their ladies, who, when mounting their carriages,
required them to crawl on all-fours that they might
make a foot-stool of their backs.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c014'><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

of this traffic were never perhaps
better illustrated than by
Barbot. This writer, while describing
the arts by which men
entice their own children, kindred,
or neighbours, to the European
factories for the purpose of selling
them, relates an anecdote exhibiting
the ne plus ultra of human
depravity: “I was told of one
who designed to sell his own
son; but he, understanding
French, dissembled for a while,
and then contrived it so cunningly
as to persuade the French
that the old man was his slave,
and not his father, by which
means he delivered him up into
captivity; and thus made good
the Italian proverb, a furbo
furbo e mezzo; amounting to
as much as ‘set a thief to catch
a thief’ or ‘diamond cuts diamond.’”

relieved of his ill-got gains and
himself sold for a slave.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r57'>57</a>. The servile wars of Sicily
assumed a far more important
character, and resembled rather
those civil commotions in states
in which one division of the citizens
carries on hostilities against
the other; for the wealth of the
islanders increasing rapidly after
the expulsion of the Carthaginians,
they purchased great multitudes
of slaves, chiefly from the
East, whom they employed in the
usual drudgery, and treated with
extraordinary rigour, branding
them in the body like cattle:—Χαρακτῆρα

<div class='footnote' id='f58'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. We may probably, however,
form some conjecture respecting
the injuries they endured from
the description of the atrocities
practised by the Sicilians against
their slaves. These unhappy men
were compelled, as history informs
us, to forego even the common
reward of labour, and, though
they toiled incessantly for their
owners, to provide for their daily
subsistence by plunder and murder:—βαρέως

<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. The history of the servile
revolt in Sicily offers numerous
points of resemblance to that of
Chios, though Eunus, the leader
of the Sicilian slaves, by no
means deserves, either for character
or abilities, to be compared
with Drimacos. Eunus
was an impostor, who, by visions
and pretended prophecies,
excited the slaves to insurrection.
He obtained credit for his
predictions by concealing a bored
walnut-shell, filled with some
fiery substance, in his mouth, and
then breathing forth sparks and
flames like a chimera. His mind,
however, was capable of ambition,
for, among the other events which
he foretold, he was careful to introduce
the fact, that he was one
day, by the decrees of heaven,
to be a king. Diodor. Sicul. 34.
Ap. Phot. Biblioth. Cod. 244. p.
384. Bekk. The contrivances by
which he supported his pretensions
to miraculous powers are
thus described by Florus, iii. 19:
Syrus quidam nomine Eunus
(magnitudo claudium facit, ut meminerimus)
fanatico furore simulato,
dum Syriæ deæ comas, jactat
ad libertatem et arma servos, quasi
numinum imperio concitavit idquæ

<div class='footnote' id='f61'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r61'>61</a>. In illustration of the ancient
practice of sealing storehouses and
other places where valuable things
were kept, we may cite the following
anecdote from Diogenes
Laertius. (iv. 8. 3.) Lacydes,
who succeeded Arcesilaus as principal
professor in the New Academy,
having, as it would appear,
a set of thievish domestics,
was in the habit of carefully
sealing the door of his storeroom;
but, in order not to run any
risk of losing the seal, he used,
unobserved, as he thought, to slip
it into the chamber through an
aperture in the door. The slaves,
however, diligently reconnoitering
his movements, discovered the
old gentleman’s secret, and visiting
his stores as often as they
thought proper, they escaped detection
by sealing the door again,
and placing through the hole the
signet where he had left it.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r62'>62</a>. The conduct of Eunus and
his followers, when, immediately
after their revolt, they took possession
of the city of Euna, presented
the most striking contrast
with this moderation of the Chian
slaves: they pillaged the houses,
and, without distinction of age
or sex, slaughtered the inhabitants,
plucking the infants from
the breasts, and dashing them
to the ground. Over part of their
atrocities the historian modestly
drops a veil: Εἰς δὲ τὰς γυναῖκας
observes he, οὐδ᾽ ἔστιν εἰπειν (καὶ
τότε βλεπόντων τῶν ἀνδρῶν) ὅσα
ἐνύβριζόν τε καὶ ἐνησέλγαινον,

<p class='c001'><a href='#r63'>63</a>. The Romans, it must be
owned, conducted the war against
Eunus, who had adopted the
style and title of a king, in a
manner more worthy of the republic.
The number of the insurgents
amounted at one time
to sixty thousand men, who,
armed with axes, slings, stakes,
and cooking-spits, defeated several
armies, and carried on hostilities
during upwards of three years.
Pursuing them, however, without
relaxation, the state prevailed at
length, utterly crushed the insurrection,
and carried Eunus a
prisoner to Rome, where, according
to Plutarch, he, like the dictator,
Sylla, was devoured by
vermin: Εἰ δὲ δεῖ καὶ των ἀπ´
οὐδενὸς μὲν χρηστοῦ γνωρίμων

<p class='c001'><a href='#r91'>91</a>. In modern times the Turks
claim the credit of superior humanity
towards their slaves who,
through marriage with their masters’
sons or daughters, often rise
to the highest degree of opulence
and distinction. Most of the
Pashas and great officers of state
have sprung from a servile origin.
The same thing may be said of
the Sultanas and principal ladies
of the empire; for which reason
the Circassian princes and nobles
have always been ambitious to
have one at least of their daughters
established in a Turkish
harem. Habesci, State of the
Ottoman Empire, chap. 31. p.
396, sqq. A correspondent of the
Malta Times, writing from Turkey,
observes: “Should the slave
object to remain with his master,
he himself has the power to go
to the market and declare he
wishes to be sold. The master
never opposes this, and it proves
such a check upon him that he
seldom dares even to scold his
slave.” Times, February 28,
1842. All this must be understood,
however, with considerable
reserve, since no traveller can pass
through the Ottoman Empire
without discovering numerous examples
of the cruelty of masters
towards their domestics.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>If we now pass from the consideration of slavery
in the comparatively mild form which it assumed
in Attica to an examination of the state of the Laconian
Helots, we shall discover the spirit which
actuated the two governments to present a still
broader contrast in this, the lowest stage of its influence,
than when operating upon the nobler citizens
on the great arena of public life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among certain scholars on the continent it appears
to be very much the fashion to oppose an
invincible scepticism to the testimony of ancient
writers, as often as that testimony makes against
any theory they desire to establish; and on the
subject of the Helots several of the ablest authors
among them have adopted an opinion which cannot
be supported without annihilating several Greek authors,
who, in their opinion, prophesy as awkwardly
as Calchas did for the peace of Agamemnon.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among these the principal is Mr. Müller, from
whom I have the misfortune to differ on many
points, but without in the least disparaging his ability
or his learning, for both of which I entertain
the highest respect.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c014'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>As, however, he has adopted a very peculiar system
in the interpretation of antiquity, which, though
plausible and ingenious, seems ill-calculated to lead
to truth, I have found it impossible to participate
on many important points the views which he maintains,
more especially on the subject of the Helots.
In fact, with all his talents and sagacity he
has chosen rather to become an advocate than an
historian, and pushes so far his eagerness to defend
his favourite people, as not unfrequently to provoke
a smile. In his derivation of the term Helot,
however, he is perhaps correct,<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c014'><sup>[158]</sup></a> it being more probable
that it should have sprung from an ancient
word signifying “The Prisoners” than from the
name of the town. In the absence of all testimony
we might likewise entertain the conjecture, “that
they were an aboriginal race subdued at a very
early period, and which immediately passed over
as slaves to the Doric conquerors.” But we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the weighty authority of Theopompos to oppose to
this inference, and the words of this historian<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c014'><sup>[159]</sup></a> attentively
considered would lead to the etymology
of the name given by Müller:—“having taken
them prisoners,” he says, “they called them εἵλωτες.”
They were, however, Greeks of the Achaian race,
who fell, together with the land, into the power of
the new-comers, so that the excuse of only tyrannising
over a foreign and half-savage race is wanting
to the Spartans, which was the object aimed
at by Mr. Müller’s ingenious conjecture.</p>

<p class='c001'>In considering the condition of the Helots, I
shall not affect, with the historian of the Doric
race,<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c014'><sup>[160]</sup></a> “to range their political rights and personal
treatment,” under separate heads; in the first place
because, strictly speaking, they had no political
rights, and, secondly, because in the treatment they
experienced consists whatever is peculiar in their
position. Several of this learned historian’s notions
on the Lacedæmonian serfs appear to be in direct
contradiction with those of the writers from whom
all we know concerning the Helots is obtained. Of
this he seems to be conscious, and in the following
way endeavours to bring discredit on them;
assuming as a settled thing, that the Helots must
have possessed political rights, he concludes that
they “were <em>doubtless exactly</em> defined by law and
custom, though the expressions made use of by
ancient authors are frequently vague and ambiguous.”<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c014'><sup>[161]</sup></a>
Whether this be the case or not we
shall presently see. The remark of Ephoros is,
that “they were in a certain point of view public
slaves. Their possessor could neither liberate them
nor sell them beyond the borders.” On this passage
which he quotes,<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c014'><sup>[162]</sup></a> the historian raises a superstructure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>which it will by no means support.
“From this,” he says, “it is evident, that they were
considered as belonging properly to the state,
which, to a certain degree, permitted them to be
possessed, and apportioned them out to individuals,
reserving to itself the power of enfranchising
them.”<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c014'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The contrary I think is the inference. They were
the property of individuals, but the state reserved
to itself the right of enfranchising them and preventing
their emancipation, lest persons should be
found who, like Marcus Porcius, Cato,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c014'><sup>[164]</sup></a> and the
Dutch at the Cape, would sell or give them their
liberty when too old to labour. “But to sell them
out of the country,” says Mr. Müller, “was not
in the power even of the state.” It is true there
was an ancient law prohibiting the exportation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the Helots,<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c014'><sup>[165]</sup></a> but the same authority which enacted
that law could have abrogated it. Had Sparta then
chosen to convert her Helots into an article of traffic,
who or what was to prevent her? Since she arrogated
to herself the right of beating, maiming, and
putting them to death,<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c014'><sup>[166]</sup></a> though completely innocent,
is it to be supposed that, had it suited her policy,
she would have hesitated to sell them? And after
all are we quite certain that these unhappy people
were not frequently sold into foreign lands? On
the contrary, we find, that a regular trade was carried
on in female Helots, who were exported into
all the neighbouring countries for nurses.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c014'><sup>[167]</sup></a> Thus it
appears that the state both had and exercised the
power to convert its serfs into merchandise.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the males also were not exported like cattle,
than which they were far worse treated, was owing
simply to the calculation, that it would be more
profitable to retain them. For, as the Spartans possessed
estates, which personally they never cultivated,
the Helots, who equally belonged to them, were stationed
throughout the country upon those estates,
which it was their business to till for the owners.
To live it was of course necessary that they should
eat, and therefore a portion of the produce was
abandoned to them, according to Tyrtæos,<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c014'><sup>[168]</sup></a> the half,
a division which must have borne very hard upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>them, since their numbers were five times greater
than those of the Spartans.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c014'><sup>[169]</sup></a> However, even in
this arrangement, the learned historian discovers
something to praise “as this quantity had been definitively
settled at a very early period (to raise the
amount being forbidden under very heavy imprecations)
the Helots were the persons who profited
by a good and lost by a bad harvest, which must
have been to them an encouragement to industry
and good husbandry; a motive which would have
been wanting if the profit and loss had merely
affected the landlords.”<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c014'><sup>[170]</sup></a> But on the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>res rusticæ</i></span>
the notions of this writer are somewhat confused.
For in another place he remarks that, owing to
the “usurpations of the successive conquerors of
Peloponnesos, agriculture was kept in a constant
state of dependence and obscurity, so that we seldom
hear of the improvement of the country, which
is a necessary part of the husbandman’s business.”
It therefore did <em>not</em> flourish in Laconia. No, says
the historian, that is not the conclusion we must
come to, for, notwithstanding that we never hear of
any improvements in it, “agriculture was always followed
with great energy and success!”<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c014'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There appear to have been instances of Helots
becoming comparatively wealthy in spite of the oppressions
they endured: but so we have known
peasants growing rich in the worst despotisms of
the East, and such too was in the middle ages the
case with the Jews, notwithstanding the terrible persecutions
and cruelties they endured. This fact,
therefore, only proves that no pressure of hardship
or ill-usage can entirely destroy the elasticity of the
spirit; and no doubt, like all slaves, the Helots
sought to soften their miseries by the gratification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>which a sense of property procures even in bondage
to the sordid mind.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c014'><sup>[172]</sup></a> “By means of the rich produce
of the land, and in part by plunder obtained
in war, they collected a considerable property, to
the attainment of which almost every access was
closed to the Spartans.”<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c014'><sup>[173]</sup></a> But of what value is
property to a man who is himself the property of
another? Besides, the <a id='corr42.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='expresssion'>expression</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_42.8'><ins class='correction' title='expresssion'>expression</ins></a></span> of the historian
in this place seems calculated to lead to erroneous
conclusions respecting the Spartans, who, so far from
being debarred the means of amassing wealth,<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c014'><sup>[174]</sup></a> rose
frequently to extraordinary opulence, insomuch that
this self-denying community came at length to be
the richest in Greece.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c014'><sup>[175]</sup></a> To assume that the Helots,
like the Thessalian Penestæ,<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c014'><sup>[176]</sup></a> enjoyed means of augmenting
their possessions superior to those permitted
themselves by their masters, is to propagate an
error which must vitiate our whole conception of
the Lacedæmonian commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is confessed that very little intercourse between
the Spartans and the Helots took place, at
least in earlier times; for afterwards, when the masters
themselves quitted the capital, resided on their
estates,<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c014'><sup>[177]</sup></a> and took to husbandry, the link must necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>have been more closely drawn. And this
circumstance renders more probable the account
transmitted to us of Spartan harshness towards
them. Intercommunion would have begotten more
humane feelings in the master, more attachment in
the slave. For like other men the Spartans felt
the influence of intimacy, as is proved by their
practice of enfranchising the companions of their
childhood. They paid, therefore, an involuntary
compliment to their own hearts when they kept
the Helots at a distance, that they might be able
to tyrannise over them. They could not have resisted
the power of close contact, and acted like
Messallina, who fled in tears from the room where
a man was pleading for his life, lest she should forgive
him, whispering as she went to her instrument
that the accused must not be suffered to escape nevertheless.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c014'><sup>[178]</sup></a>
However, a certain number of Helots
were retained in the city as personal attendants on
the Spartans, and there waited at the public tables,
and were lent by one person to another,<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c014'><sup>[179]</sup></a> like so
many dogs, or oxen; although it seems probable
that all the drudgery of the capital was not performed
by the Helots alone, but that along with
them were associated other classes of domestic
slaves,<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c014'><sup>[180]</sup></a> on whose history and condition antiquity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>affords us little or no light. But as the Spartans
were constantly making prisoners in their wars with
the neighbouring states, which were occasionally restored
at the termination of hostilities, we appear
to be authorized in concluding, that these captives
were commonly reduced to servitude in Laconia,
whether employed in household labours,<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c014'><sup>[181]</sup></a> or dispersed
among the Helots in the field.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another service the Helots performed for their
masters, which necessarily produced some degree of
intimacy, I mean the military service in which they
fought and bled by their side.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c014'><sup>[182]</sup></a> The state was, no
doubt, reluctant to admit them among the Hoplitæ,
or heavy-armed, where the discipline was rigorous,
and their weapons would have placed them on a
level with their oppressors. But even this was
sometimes hazarded, as in the reinforcements forwarded
to Gyleppus, at Syracuse,<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c014'><sup>[183]</sup></a> when six hundred
Neodomades and picked Helots were complimented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>with this dangerous distinction. As light
troops, however, they almost invariably formed the
majority of the Lacedæmonian forces. In other countries,
where the subject races were more humanely
treated, no fear was entertained at entrusting them
with arms. Among the Dardanians, for example,
where it was not uncommon for a private individual
to possess a thousand slaves, or more, they in time
of peace cultivated the land, and in war filled the
ranks of the army, their masters serving as officers.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c014'><sup>[184]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From this circumstance one of two things must
be inferred; either that the Dardanians considered
them in the light of subjects, as we do the natives
of India, where large armies are officered by Englishmen,
or that that people understood better than
any other in antiquity the art of ruling over men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Plato, Isocrates, Aristotle, Plutarch, and a number
of other writers agree in convicting the Spartans of
great barbarity towards their bondsmen, differing,
however, as to the degree of that barbarity. But
their “philanthropic views”<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c014'><sup>[185]</sup></a> are discarded by the
historian, who with the skill of an able pleader,
overlooks these great writers, whom he could not
treat with so much want of ceremony, to bring forward
the picture of Myron of Priene, whose history
he denominates a romance, and whose testimony
he contumeliously rejects. In order the more
completely, as he thinks, to demolish this humble
writer he quotes the following passage of his work
preserved by Athenæus: “The Helots perform for
the Spartans every ignominious service. They are
<em>compelled</em> to wear a cap of dog-skin,<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c014'><sup>[186]</sup></a> to bear a
covering of sheep-skin, and are severely beaten
every year without having committed any fault,
in order that they may never forget they are
slaves. In addition to this, those <a id='corr45.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='amonst'>amongst</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_45.36'><ins class='correction' title='amonst'>amongst</ins></a></span> them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>who, either by their stature or their beauty, raise
themselves above the condition of a slave are condemned
to death, and the masters who do not destroy
the most manly of them are liable to punishment.”<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c014'><sup>[187]</sup></a>
The accusation here made is a serious one, and the
apologist naturally feels his indignation kindle against
its author. In this state of mind he employs very
harsh language, charges Myron with “ignorance and
partiality,” and altogether speaks as if he were in
possession of facts wherewith to demolish the Prenian’s
statement. But has he any? Not a single
one. He misunderstands entirely the gist of Myron’s
words, in the matter of the dog-skin cap, and
then, on the strength of his own error, presumes to
accuse him of misrepresentation. It is at the first
blush evident that Myron considered the hardship to
consist, not in the wearing of the cap, but in being
compelled to wear it. Mr. Müller’s examples, consequently,
are nothing to the purpose; they simply
prove that other people had endured similar hardships,
(the mention of Laërtes is superfluous,) nevertheless,
without having uttered one syllable to justify
his triumph, he proceeds with much self-satisfaction
to remark, that “since Myron <em>manifestly</em> misrepresents
this circumstance, <em>it is very probable</em> that
his other objections are founded in error.”<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c014'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the allegations of Myron, as the reader will
perceive, remain not only untouched, but more confirmed
and established than ever by such a defence.
It happens, in fact, that they are true to the letter,
and what is more, are by no means the gravest imputation
which can be substantiated against the
Dorian model-state. We shall proceed, however,
step by step examining fairly, and in order, the
charges and the defence. Plutarch,<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c014'><sup>[189]</sup></a> whose testimony,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>when favourable, is unhesitatingly accepted, “relates
that the Helots were compelled to intoxicate themselves,
and perform indecent dances as a warning
to the Spartan youth.”<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c014'><sup>[190]</sup></a> Shall we credit Plutarch?
No we must not; because “common sense is opposed
to so absurd a method of education.” But
if everything in history which we may determine
to be opposed to common sense were on that account
to be rejected, we should make sad inroads
upon the domains of antiquity. That which increases
the ridicule of the practice is, that from
among those same Helots they selected tutors for
their younger children,<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c014'><sup>[191]</sup></a> as well as companions, so
that in the very article wherein Xenophon<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c014'><sup>[192]</sup></a> discovered
the superiority of Lycurgus’s educational system,
it was completely on a level with that of the
other Greeks, habituating the youth to the intimacy
and government of slaves.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c014'><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>If, however, the relation of Plutarch stood alone,
its force would be less, though with no face could
we reject it while admitting in other respects his
favourable testimony. But from many authors, besides
him, it is clear, that to demoralise the Helots
was the constant policy of Sparta. Thus when the
Thasians brought a number of useless dainties to
Agesilaos and his army: “Give them,” said he, “to
those Helots, whom it is better to corrupt than
ourselves.”<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c014'><sup>[194]</sup></a> Consistently with the same system,
and the more completely to debase their minds,
they were commanded to sing obscene songs and
perform indecent jigs, while the Pyrrhic dance and
every warlike lay was forbidden them. In proof of
this, it is related, that when the Thebans, under
Epaminondas, invaded Laconia, and made prisoners
a number of the Helots, they commanded them to
sing them some of the songs of Sparta, of Spendon,
for example, or Alcman, or Terpander. But the
Helots<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c014'><sup>[195]</sup></a> professed their inability, observing, that the
acquisition of those lays was forbidden them. In
short, to adopt the words of Theopompos, they
were at all times cruelly and bitterly treated;<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c014'><sup>[196]</sup></a>
deluded, sometimes, from the protection of sanctuary
by perjury, and then coolly assassinated in contempt
of religion and oaths, as in the case of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>suppliants who took refuge in the temple of Poseidon
at Tænaros.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c014'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But all this harsh usage was mild compared with
other injuries which the laws of Sparta inflicted on
them. The reader will perceive that I am about
to speak of the Crypteia, not one feature of which,
to my mind, has been softened or explained away,
or rendered doubtful by the ingenious but very useless
special pleading of some distinguished scholars
among our contemporaries.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c014'><sup>[198]</sup></a> Mr. Müller, with much
intrepidity, leads the van of Sparta’s defenders, and,
by an artifice not unfamiliar to rhetoricians, seeks to
beat down the authorities on which belief in the
Crypteia rests. He affects to think slightingly of
their means of obtaining information, though certainly,
in this respect, at least, the very meanest of them
possessed incalculable advantages over himself. However,
of Isocrates he thus unceremoniously disposes:
“Isocrates speaks of this institution in a very confused
manner and from mere report.”<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c014'><sup>[199]</sup></a> On the
contrary, this “old man eloquent,” as Milton affectionately
terms him, luminously, (would that Mr.
Müller and I possessed equal art!) and upon the
best authorities,<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c014'><sup>[200]</sup></a> sketches the history of the Lacedæmonian
government, its injustice, its oppressions;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and concludes by describing the annual massacre of
the Helots. It is worthy of remark, that, with Aristotle,<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c014'><sup>[201]</sup></a>
he attributes to the Ephori the direction of
this servile war, in which the reins of slaughter
were loosed or tightened by their authority.</p>

<p class='c001'>The relation, however, of Isocrates, who probably
descended to particulars, appears not to have come
down to us entire. Plutarch, though he be the
panegyrist, rather than the faithful historian, of
Sparta, has supplied the deficiency. He does so,
indeed, reluctantly; trumpets in the narration with
epic flourishes, seeking, by all the art he is master
of, to shield his beloved Lycurgus from the stern
but deserved rebuke of Plato.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c014'><sup>[202]</sup></a> Too honest, however,
was the old Bœotian entirely to suppress the
truth. So that, at length, after much preparation,
the massacre is described hurriedly, briefly, with
vehement unwillingness, but, for that very reason,
with the more terrible effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having enumerated the regulations affecting the
free citizens, “In these,” he says, “there is no trace
of that injustice and griping ambition which some
object to the institutions of Lycurgus, considering
them well adapted to beget bravery though not
honest principles. It was probably the institution
of the Crypteia (if as Aristotle contends, it proceeded
from Lycurgus) that inspired Plato with
such an opinion of the legislator and his laws.
According to this ordinance the rulers, selecting
from among the youths those most distinguished
for ability, sent them forth armed with daggers
and furnished with the necessary provisions, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>scour the country, separating and concealing themselves
in unfrequented places by day, but issuing
out at night and slaughtering all such of the Helots
as they found abroad. Sometimes, indeed,
they fell upon them while engaged in their rural
labours in the fields, and there cut off the best
and bravest of the race.”<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c014'><sup>[203]</sup></a> Plutarch felt that connected
with this system, as flowing from the same
principle of policy and designed to effect the same
purpose, were those extensive massacres recorded in
history, by one of which more than two thousand
of those unhappy men, having been insidiously deluded
into the assertion of sentiments conformable
to the gallant actions they had performed in the
service of the state,<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c014'><sup>[204]</sup></a> were removed in a day. Lulled
by the gift of freedom, crowned, smiled upon, they
were conducted to the temples, as if to implicate
the very gods in the treachery:—and then suddenly
they disappeared; nor to this hour has the fate which
overtook them been revealed.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c014'><sup>[205]</sup></a> Compared with this
the slaughter of the Janisaries appears less culpable.</p>

<p class='c001'>But had Sparta no apology to offer, for these
actions, to humanity? Her rulers discovered one
which appears to have satisfied their own consciences.
Every year, on taking office, the Ephori, formally, in
their good city of Sparta, declared war against their
unarmed and unhappy vassals, “that they might be
massacred under pretence of law.”<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c014'><sup>[206]</sup></a> Mr. Müller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>overwhelmed with the weight of these testimonies,
does not yet yield up the point: “Were not these
Helots, who in many districts lived entirely alone,
united by despair for the sake of common protection;
and did they not every year kindle a most
bloody and determined war throughout the whole
of Laconia?” The historian is pleasant upon the
Helots. Kindle a war! How happens it that the
Chinese, who, at many periods of their history, have
rivalled the Helots in suffering, and like them, too,
have rebelled occasionally, yet make annually no
“bloody and determined war” against the Mantchoo
Tartars? The answer is written on every page of
the history of the world, and was put in form by
Alexander when he inquired whether one butcher
were afraid of many sheep? Nevertheless, even
the spirit of slavery itself did sometimes revolt
against oppression and cruelty, and kindled such
“bloody and determined wars” as Sparta, without
foreign aid, was unable to terminate. They were,
in fact, during many years, prevented from disputing
with the Athenians the supremacy in Greece, by
contests with their own vassals.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c014'><sup>[207]</sup></a> And on the occasion
of the great earthquake when nearly every
house in Sparta was shaken to the ground,<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c014'><sup>[208]</sup></a> did
not the Helots rejoice at the calamity, and come
flocking to the environs of the city from the whole
country round, in order to put an end to their
tyrants as they were escaping in terror from their
tottering habitations? Revolt, then, was not unfamiliar
to the Helots—again and again was the
standard of freedom unfurled<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c014'><sup>[209]</sup></a>—and the day, though
late, at length came, when the Spartan saw his
slave placed on a level with himself.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c014'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To render credible this sketch of cruelty, the character
and education of the Spartans must be kept
in view:</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos,</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c019'>was not their maxim.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c014'><sup>[211]</sup></a> They loved to trample on
the fallen. Even in boyhood and among themselves,
they practised <em>gouging</em> as an accomplishment,
and as an Athenian did music—as a necessary
consequence, even the writers most favourable to
their state, confess them to have been brutal, inhuman,
perfidious.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c014'><sup>[212]</sup></a> Nor among a people so ignorant,
so prejudiced, so narrow-minded, whose understandings
were possibly incapable of comprehending the
idea of justice or liberality, can we altogether wonder
at such an outbreak of barbarism. Men have
been known in modern times to shoot slaves for
their amusement; a king of France has been known
from the same motive to shoot his subjects, and
a learned professor,<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c014'><sup>[213]</sup></a> not very remarkable for cruelty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>has pronounced the panegyric of that king. There
is nothing, therefore, at all incredible in the Spartan
Crypteia, which exactly harmonizes with all we
know of the nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>An attempt, however, has been made to explain
the whole away, by the unauthorized inference, that
in the casual glance which Megillos, in the laws
of Plato, makes at this institution, we have a complete
description of it in all its features. But very
far is this from being the case. The Spartan interlocutor
is there making out a defence of his
own country, and consequently alludes only to such
points as appear capable of a favourable interpretation.
Of course he is careful to keep the massacre
of the Helots in the back-ground; and merely
says, “There is also amongst us what is called the
Crypteia, the pain of undergoing which is scarcely
credible. It consists in going barefoot in storms,
in enduring the privations of the camp, performing
menial offices without a servant, and wandering
night and day through the whole country.”<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c014'><sup>[214]</sup></a>
This is the picture of a Spartan, dwelling on his
own hardships; which, however, must have been
endured for some purpose, and what was that? If
exercise and military seasoning were alone aimed at,
where was the necessity for that concealment, that
lying in ambush, which the word itself signifies?
It is well known that the Helots were a constant
terror to their masters—that whenever occasion offered,
they revolted—whenever any enemy to the
state presented himself, they joined him—that they
fled whenever flight was possible—and were, it is
confessed, so numerous and so bold, that Sparta was
compelled, in treaties with foreign states, to stipulate
“for aid against her own subjects.”<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c014'><sup>[215]</sup></a> What
more probable, therefore, under the circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>than the institution of the Crypteia? What more
in harmony with the genius of the people?</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be no doubt that on certain extraordinary
occasions these chief of slaves obtained their
freedom from the state; but that any “legal way
to liberty and citizenship stood open to them,”<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c014'><sup>[216]</sup></a>
does not appear.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c014'><sup>[217]</sup></a> The chain of “probabilities” by
which this conclusion is attempted to be arrived
at is perfectly unique, and would lead with equal
force to any other whatever. “The many intermediate
steps, it is said, <em>seem to prove</em> the existence
of a regular mode of transition from the
one rank to the other.” It has not, however,
been proved that there were any intermediate steps;
and the very attempt is based almost wholly on a
fragment of that Myron of Priene, whose Messenian
History Mr. Müller denominates a romance, and
whose “partiality and ignorance” he considers so
self-evident but a few passages back.</p>

<p class='c001'>1. The Helots who were esteemed worthy of an
“especial confidence were called ἀργεῖοι.”<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c014'><sup>[218]</sup></a> This
however, is no intermediate step, as it is not said
that their being thus called was necessarily followed
by any result.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. The ἐρυκτῆρες enjoyed the same “(especial confidence)
in war.”<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c014'><sup>[219]</sup></a> On points of this kind it is necessary
to rely on some authority, and the historian
adduces none.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c014'><sup>[220]</sup></a> It has, indeed, been conjectured,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>from the derivation of their name, that this class
of freedmen served as a body-guard to their former
masters. Positively, however, nothing whatever
is known of their condition.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. The ἀφέται were, <em>probably</em>, released from “all
service.” The expression of Eustathius<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c014'><sup>[221]</sup></a> is, “being
made free, they were called aphetæ.”</p>

<p class='c001'>4. “The δεσποσιοναύται,<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c014'><sup>[222]</sup></a> who served in the fleet,
resembled, <em>probably</em>, the freedmen of Attica, who
were called the <em>out-dwellers</em>.”<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c014'><sup>[223]</sup></a> This phrase is calculated
to convey an erroneous impression, as though
these freedmen necessarily took up their quarters
in the country, whereas οἱ χωρὶς οἰκούντες merely signifies
persons who have establishments of their own.
With respect to the Desposionautæ, they would
appear to have been slaves brought up in their
masters’ houses, and afterwards enfranchised, and
ordered to be employed about the fleet.</p>

<p class='c001'>5. “When they (the Helots) received their liberty,
they also obtained permission <em>to dwell where
they wished</em>, and, <em>probably</em>, at the same time, <a id='corr56.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“a'>a</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_56.18'><ins class='correction' title='“a'>a</ins></a></span>
portion of land was granted to them without the
lot of their former masters.” This is drawing a
general inference from a particular case. Thucydides,<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c014'><sup>[224]</sup></a>
the authority relied on, speaks only of those
Helots who having served in Thrace under Brasidas,
obtained enfranchisement on their return, together
with a portion of the lands recently taken from the
Lepreatæ. On other occasions, as the whole of
Laconia and Messenia had been divided among the
citizens, it is difficult to understand whence the state
could have obtained lands to bestow. The <em>probability</em>,
therefore, is, that they bestowed none.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the Neodamodes or “new citizens,” our knowledge
is little less scanty than of the other classes
of freedmen. That they were enfranchised Helots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>is confidently maintained by several learned writers,
though others suppose them to have been the sons
of enfranchised Helots.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c014'><sup>[225]</sup></a> This latter supposition, however,
is inconsistent with the testimony of Myron,
who observes, that “the Lacedæmonians often emancipated
their slaves, some of whom were then called
<em>aphetæ</em>, others <em>adespotæ</em>, others <em>eructeres</em>, others
<em>desposionautæ</em>; there were others whom they denominated
<em>neodamodes</em>, different from the Helots.”<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c014'><sup>[226]</sup></a>
Of those modern writers who have treated of the
Spartan institutions, some elude the discussion altogether,
while others acquiescing in the commonly
received opinion contend, that the Neodamodes were
those Helots who, having conducted themselves gallantly
in war, had for some time enjoyed their freedom.
But this decision, however plausible it may
seem, is by no means satisfactory. For, wherever
Thucydides, or any other historian of authority, has
occasion to mention this class of freedmen, they
appear to be carefully distinguished from the enfranchised
Helots. Thus, when the companions of
Brasidas, before spoken of, had received their freedom,
and were sent as settlers into the Lepreatis,
it is added, that they were accompanied by a number
of Neodamodes.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c014'><sup>[227]</sup></a> But if this term signified nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>more than Helots who had been rewarded with liberty,
in what did they differ from the other Helots
who had likewise been made free? One learned
commentator,<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c014'><sup>[228]</sup></a> not without ingenuity, infers that
they were a class of tributary subjects inhabiting the
neighbourhood of the capital, on whom the right
of citizenship had been conferred, though they did
not enjoy perfect equality with the elder citizens.
But, as it is distinctly stated, that they were enfranchised
slaves, we are compelled to abandon even
this hypothesis, and seek to discover some other clue
to the truth.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has already been observed, that the Spartans
appear to have possessed numbers of slaves properly
so called, besides their oppressed and miserable bondsmen,
with whom they seem often to have been confounded.
These, by being more constantly about their
masters, were, doubtless, able to gain more upon their
affections, and could not possibly be viewed with
equal dread, since they were necessarily brought together
from various countries, and connected consequently
by no bond of union. As often, therefore,
as the state required a fresh supply of citizens,
it is from among these that they appear to have
been selected; and that, too, in numbers so considerable,
that Agesilaos, on one occasion, was enabled
to select two thousand to attend him on an
expedition wherein he was accompanied by only
thirty Spartans.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c014'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another class of persons<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c014'><sup>[230]</sup></a> commonly ranked among
the Laconian slaves were the Mothaces,<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c014'><sup>[231]</sup></a> to determine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>whose origin, rank, and condition, appears to
be a matter of no small difficulty. That they never,
during the flourishing ages of the commonwealth,
formed any part of the servile caste may be regarded
as certain, whatever may be found to the
contrary in the grammarians of later times. For
the Mothaces, observes Athenæus, though not Lacedæmonians,
were <em>free</em>. And to the same purpose
speaks Philarchos, whose words are: “The Mothaces
were the brotherlike companions of the Lacedæmonians.
For every youthful citizen, according
to his means, chose one, two, or more of
these to be brought up along with him; and, notwithstanding
that they enjoyed not the rank of citizens,
they were <em>free</em>, and participated in all the
advantages of the national education. It is even
said that Lysander, who defeated the Athenians
at sea, was one of this class of men, but raised
to the rank of citizen for his valour.”<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c014'><sup>[232]</sup></a> To the
same section of the Laconian population belonged
also Callicratidas and Gylippos,<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c014'><sup>[233]</sup></a> a circumstance which
of itself appears completely to overthrow the hypothesis
of those who derive the Mothaces directly
from the Helots; for Cleandridas, the father of Gylippos,<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c014'><sup>[234]</sup></a>
was chosen to accompany King Pleistoanax,
as chief of his councillors, during an expedition
into Attica, an honour which would not, I imagine,
have been conferred upon a Helot. Again, Lysander,
whom by one authority we are taught to regard
as a Mothax, is by another spoken of not
barely as a Spartan, but as descended from the
Heracleidæ.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c014'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>How then are we to reconcile these seeming
contradictions? Probably by supposing, that the
Mothaces consisted, first of the sons of such Spartans
as were too poor to defray the expenses of
their maintenance and education,<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c014'><sup>[236]</sup></a> which seems to
have been the case with Aristocritos, the father of
Lysander, whose early indigence is celebrated; secondly
of bastard Spartans, who it is well known
shared the education of their legitimate brethren;
and thirdly, of the sons of persons of rank and
distinction among the Periœci. To these perhaps,
in very late times, the sons of favourite slaves born
in the house may have been added, though there
is no ground for believing that this was habitually
the case in the earlier ages. Be this, however, as
it may, it seems to be quite evident, that Lycurgus
laid much less stress on “birth and blood” than
on that steadiness and patience of toil which are
the first qualities of a soldier. Whoever from childhood
upward gave proof of these, by submitting
unmurmuringly to the rigorous trial he enjoined the
youth of Sparta, was elevated in the end to the
rank of a citizen, while they who shrunk from the
severity of his discipline, according to some even
though they had descended from the blood royal,
sunk into a state of degradation or were even
confounded with the Helots.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c014'><sup>[237]</sup></a> Foreigners who enjoyed
the privileges of this system of instruction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>received among the Lacedæmonians the name of
Trophimoi.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the Epeunactæ, a peculiar class of freedmen,
we have the following curious account: Having in
the Messenian war lost a number of Spartans, the
government began to apprehend that the enemy
might discover its weakness; to conceal which a Helot
was substituted in the place of every fallen warrior.
Shortly afterwards these men were raised to
the rank of citizens and denominated Epeunactæ,
because they occupied the beds (εὐναι) of other men.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c014'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But wherever men are base-minded there will be
slaves; and accordingly we find that, in all other
parts of Greece, no less than at Sparta, this miserable
class existed for the performance of servile
drudgery. Posidonios, the Stoic,<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c014'><sup>[239]</sup></a> observes, that
persons lacking sense to provide for themselves, voluntarily
became the slaves of any who would take
care of them. Thus the Maryandinians submitted
to the citizens of Heraclea,<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c014'><sup>[240]</sup></a> to be their perpetual
serfs, stipulating only that they should always be
furnished with the necessaries of life, and on no
account be sold out of the country. They were in
fact simply tributaries, as is implied in the verse
of Euphorion, the epic poet,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Gift-bearers called, who cower before their chiefs.”<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c014'><sup>[241]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>This appellation of Gift-bearers—though their gifts,
like the royal benevolences of our ancestors, were extorted
from them—was no doubt however invented,
as Callicratos<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c014'><sup>[242]</sup></a> observes, to disguise the true nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>of their condition. Besides engaging in agricultural
labours, they likewise served on board ship,
and consequently contributed greatly to increase the
commerce and naval power of Heraclea.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c014'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Thessalians denominated Penestæ,<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c014'><sup>[244]</sup></a> not those
who were born in servitude, but persons who were
made captive in war. They were sometimes also
known by the name of Thettaloiketes. Archemachos,
in his History of Eubœa, affords illustration
of a very curious point of ancient history mentioned
briefly but with some variation, by Thucydides.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c014'><sup>[245]</sup></a> According
to him, certain Bœotians migrating northward,
founded Arnæa in Thessaly; after which some returned
to Bœotia, while, delighted with the land,
others remained, and became the voluntary villains
of the Thessalians. Here, however, as elsewhere in
like cases, it was stipulated that they should neither
be put to death nor sold beyond the borders; while
on their part they agreed to cultivate the land and
pay the requisite tribute.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c014'><sup>[246]</sup></a> On this account they
were called Menestæ,<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c014'><sup>[247]</sup></a> that is “those who remain,”
which appellation was by degrees corrupted into
Penestæ. Of these serfs many were richer than
their masters. Euripides,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c014'><sup>[248]</sup></a> in his “Phryxas,” observes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>moreover, that they were sometimes of very
ancient families. Thucydides, on the other hand,
represents them to have been the original inhabitants
of Arnè, driven thence by the Thessalians sixty
years after the Trojan war, though a portion of the
nation had long before settled in Bœotia and joined
in the expedition against Troy.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c014'><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A state of things not greatly dissimilar<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c014'><sup>[250]</sup></a> prevailed
in Crete, where the servile caste was divided into
several classes: first, those of the cities, called
Chrysonetæ, or “bought with gold,” who were doubtless
barbarians; second, those of the country, who
received the name of Aphamiotæ,<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c014'><sup>[251]</sup></a> from their being
bound to the Aphamiæ, or estates of the landed
gentry. These were the aboriginal tribes of the
island reduced to servitude by a nation of foreign conquerors.
They were sometimes likewise denominated
Clarotæ,<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c014'><sup>[252]</sup></a> from their having been divided among the
conquerors by κλᾶρος, or lot; or, according to others,
from their being located on the lots of the citizens
which were called κλᾶροι.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c014'><sup>[253]</sup></a> In condition, the Aphamiotæ
resembled the Helots,<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c014'><sup>[254]</sup></a> and differed from the
peasantry, or Hypekooi,<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c014'><sup>[255]</sup></a> in much the same degree
as the purchased private slaves of the Turks differ
from their <em>rayahs</em>, or subjects. These are habitually
protected from being sold out of the country; though
in cases of revolt the captives are reduced to the
level of the common slaves, and sold like cattle.
Thus the markets of Egypt were crowded with Cretans
after the late revolt against Mohammed Ali.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Third, there existed in every state in Crete a class
of public bondsmen denominated Mnoia or Mnoa,
because reduced to that condition by Minos.<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c014'><sup>[256]</sup></a> These
serfs cultivated the public lands, upon what conditions
is not exactly known: it merely appears that
they were compelled to furnish the body of the citizens
a certain sum of money, together with a part
of their flocks and herds and agricultural produce.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c014'><sup>[257]</sup></a>
That they were sufficiently numerous and powerful
to inspire their masters with dread, is evident from
the regulation by which they were excluded from
the gymnasia, and prohibited the use of arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides these, there was another class of the Cretan
population which must by no means be confounded
with the slaves or serfs,—I mean, the Hypekooi.<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c014'><sup>[258]</sup></a>
These were the inhabitants of the smaller
towns who had lost their political independence,
but were permitted the use of arms, and allowed to
frequent the public places of exercise, like the nobler
citizens.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c014'><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the city of Cydonia, during certain festivals of
Hermes, the slaves were left masters of the place,
into which no free citizen had permission to enter;
and if he infringed this regulation it was in their
power to chastise him with whips.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c014'><sup>[260]</sup></a> In other parts
of Crete customs similar to those of the Roman
Saturnalia prevailed; for, while the slaves in the
Hermæan festival were carousing and taking their
ease, their lords, travestied into domestics, waited
upon them at table, and performed, in their stead,
all other menial offices. Something of the same kind
took place during the month Gerœstion, at Trœzen,
where the citizens feasted their slaves on one
day of the great annual festival, and played at dice
with them.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c014'><sup>[261]</sup></a> Among the Babylonians, moreover, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>find a similar custom; for, during the Sacæan festival,
which lasted five days, and was celebrated in the
month of August,<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c014'><sup>[262]</sup></a> the owners waited on their slaves,
one of whom, habited in a royal robe, enacted the
part of king.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the whole it may be inferred, that the
treatment and condition of the Cretan serfs were
milder than in any other Doric state, though it
would be incorrect to decide,<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c014'><sup>[263]</sup></a> that they were less
oppressed than in any other state in all Greece,
since we discover in the song of Hybrias traces
not to be mistaken of their abject state:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Great riches have I in my spear and sword,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hairy shield, like a rampart thrown</div>
      <div class='line'>Before me in war; for by these I am lord</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the fields where the golden harvests are grown;</div>
      <div class='line'>And by these I press forth the red red wine,</div>
      <div class='line'>While the Mnotæ around salute me king;</div>
      <div class='line'>Approaching, trembling, these knees of mine,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the dread which the spear and the faulchion bring.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c014'><sup>[264]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The Periœci of Crete are said never to have revolted
against their masters; but this arose, as Aristotle
observes, from the circumstance that every state
having serfs of the same kind, it was not for the
interest of any one in their wars to set their bondsmen
a bad example by enticing any to join in those
struggles.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c014'><sup>[265]</sup></a>. The Penestæ of Thessaly, and the Helots,
often joined the enemy, because the neighbouring
states possessed no similar serfs. But, in
the case of the Cretan Periœci, the circumstance
already noticed of their not being allowed to frequent
the gymnasia,<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c014'><sup>[266]</sup></a> or possess arms, will account
satisfactorily for their perseverance in the ancient
manners, without supposing in them any preference
for those manners, which, as they were deprived of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>all the privileges of citizens, they could scarcely
have felt.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c014'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting the servile classes in other Grecian
states our information is very scanty: we simply
know that the serfs of the Syracusans were denominated
Killicyrii,<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c014'><sup>[268]</sup></a> and exceedingly numerous, so
that “more in number than the Killicyrii,” became
a proverb. They would seem to have dwelt
chiefly in the country like the Cretan Mnotæ. In
process of time, however, their multitude inspired
them with courage; they assaulted and drove out
their masters, and, fortune favouring their enterprise,
retained possession of Syracuse. Among several of
the Italian states, the subject classes were known by
the name of Pelasgi. The people of Rhodes reduced
and kept in bondage the inhabitants of Caunos,
and the celebrated painter Protogenes<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c014'><sup>[269]</sup></a> was the
son of one of these bondsmen.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the same relation stood the Bithynians to the
people of Byzantium; the Leleges to the Carians,
and the Katanocophori to the people of Sicyon.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c014'><sup>[270]</sup></a>
These last would seem to have been originally<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c014'><sup>[271]</sup></a>
merely the rustic population deprived of their freedom
by the tyrants, who compelled them to affect
a mean and squalid appearance, and to wear sheepskin
cloaks,<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c014'><sup>[272]</sup></a> that they might be ashamed to frequent
the city, where they would have been exposed
to the laughter and insults of the rabble.</p>

<p class='c001'>The corresponding class among the Arcadians, denominated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Prospelatæ<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c014'><sup>[273]</sup></a> were said to have amounted
to three hundred thousand in number. Their
treatment was probably more lenient than in many
other parts of Greece, as we find them on public
festivals sitting down at table with their masters,
like our old farm-servants, eating of the same food,
and drinking from the same cup.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c014'><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

that domestic slaves are generally
corrupt in manners and ignoble

sure from an attentive observation,
of human nature, that, even
were it not so, their masters
would inevitably seek to justify
their own cruelty and injustice
by depreciating the moral character
of their dependents. Thus
the ablest of Spanish writers,
actuated less perhaps by theory
than by instinct, strives to extenuate
the conduct of their countrymen
towards the natives of
America by attributing to them
the most odious and repulsive
qualities: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Les Indiens,”</span> observes
Ulloa, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“sont moins à
craindre par leur valeur que
par leur perfidie, et par la ruse

leur attentats. Victorieux par
surprise, ils sont cruels à l’excès,

de compassion. Leur
cruauté est toujours accompagnée
de sang froid, leur plaisir

dans le second ils cherchent à

prient, supplient, et se montrent
dans toute leur conduite

  <h2 class='c004'>BOOK VI. <br /> COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id='ch6.1' class='c012'>CHAPTER I. <br /> CONDITION OF THE POOR.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Respecting the condition of the poor, in ancient
nations, very little is commonly known, the great
historians, the tragic poets, and the other classic
writers who enjoy what may be termed popularity,
not having bestowed their attention on the subject;
and to mine, for this species of knowledge, amid the
speculations of philosophers, or the dusky rubbish
of scholiasts and lexicographers, being a task for
which few have patience. Even those writers who
might have been expected to enter fully into this
matter, supply but slight and unsatisfactory information,
either because they attached little importance
to the question, or because it did not enter into
their design to examine in all their details the poor-laws
of Athens, or the numerous sources of private
and public charity which circumscribed the operation
of those laws. To the best of my ability I shall
endeavour to supply the deficiency.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the earlier ages of the commonwealth there
existed no class of citizens so necessitous as to require
the aid of charity.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c014'><sup>[275]</sup></a> The democracy was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>disgraced by the beggary of one of its members;
for, though many, compared with their neighbours,
might be poor, none were reduced to sordid indigence,
or so lacked credit as to be unable to command
the means of engaging in some profitable
branch of industry. Afterwards, however, through
the calamitous events of war, and that deterioration
seemingly inherent in all forms of government, the
number of the indigent exceeded that of the wealthy,<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c014'><sup>[276]</sup></a>
(as in every modern country it does,) and distress
and destitution occupying entirely the thoughts of
the sufferers, corroded to the core that spirit of
patriotism which had distinguished their ancestors.
But the institutions of Athens, having been truly
designed to promote the happiness and provide for
the wants of the people, the attention of the legislature
was immediately directed to the evil.</p>

<p class='c001'>As this was the first developement of the spirit of
charity, it naturally appeared feeble at the outset,
and only acquired strength and volume by degrees.
A beginning was made in the case of those who had
been disabled in war,<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c014'><sup>[277]</sup></a> and of the children left behind
by citizens who fell in defence of their country.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the former a pension, in early times of one
obolos a-day, was allowed: the latter<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c014'><sup>[278]</sup></a> may be said
to have been adopted by the state which maintained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>and educated them till the age of eighteen, when,
having been taught some trade or business, they were
considered able to provide for themselves.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c014'><sup>[279]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With whom this humane institution originated is
not agreed. In the case of disabled soldiers the
honour has, by some, been attributed to Peisistratos,
by others to Solon. Bœckh, though he acknowledges
that the latter “certainly gave the example
to Peisistratos,” considers it not improbable that, for
the benefit of this important lesson, humanity is
indebted to the tyrant, who, he observes, “was of
a mild disposition; and usurpers are generally glad
to seize every opportunity of conferring a benefit,
with a view to make themselves popular; nor
would the Athenians, with their hatred to tyranny,
have attributed this honour to him if he had not
deserved it.”<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c014'><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of this I am not sure. Peisistratos, a consummate
politician, having unjustly rendered himself
master of the state, was, no doubt, careful to appropriate
to himself as many as possible of the
honours due to Solon, the mildest of all legislators;
and, if he abstained from abrogating such a law,
might contrive to pass for its author. Certain, at
all events, it is, that a tradition long existed among
the ancients which attributed the institution to Solon;<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c014'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
and however mild and popular in manners
the tyrant may have been, it will still, perhaps, be
acknowledged that in those qualities he was excelled
by the great legislator.</p>

<p class='c001'>By what steps the law, originally instituted with
reference solely to citizens disabled in war, came
afterwards to embrace the aged, the sick, the blind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and infirm of every description, is not known. It
did not, however, require them to be absolutely
destitute before they could receive relief. Any citizen
whose property did not exceed three minæ, or
twelve pounds sterling,<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c014'><sup>[282]</sup></a> was entitled to the allowance;
to eke out which he might keep a small
shop, or apply himself to any other branch of industry
within his competence. The laws, in fact,
were on this point exceedingly liberal, justly considering
it to be the duty of society to make up
as far as possible for the injuries of fortune.
There was little danger of the state’s humanity being
abused. The people themselves examined into
every case, which in a community so limited they
could easily do, and afterwards it was still in the
power of any citizen, who suspected imposition, to
bring an action against the offender before the Senate
of Five Hundred.</p>

<p class='c001'>The speech of a defendant in a cause of this
kind has come down to us. It was written for
the unfortunate citizen by Lysias; and I own I can
discover in it nothing of that “jesting tone,” which,
in the opinion of some writers, proves it to be a mere
rhetorical exercise.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c014'><sup>[283]</sup></a> On the contrary, it breathes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of that manly confidence, which it became the citizen,
however poor, of a republican state, to feel.
We must not conceive of him as a miserable pauper
whining to a board of guardians. He understood
the intent and meaning of the law, and certain that
his case entitled him to the relief it was designed
to afford, he spoke before the Senate like a man
claiming no more than was equitably due to him;
and too well assured of the humanity and justice
of his countrymen to be under much apprehension.
He kept a small shop, it appears, in the vicinity of
the agora, and one of the principal points dwelt on
by the prosecutor was, that he there drew together
a number of saunterers and newsmongers, such as
usually at Athens frequented the shops of barbers,
perfumers, &amp;c., in that fashionable part of the town.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c014'><sup>[284]</sup></a>
Another point was, that he sometimes rode on
horseback, which, in the opinion of the accusers,
a man receiving aid from the state should not have
done. But, to this part of the accusation, he replies,
that, being so lame as to be compelled to
make use of crutches, he was wholly unable to
answer the more distant calls of business without
hiring a horse, the expense of which only augmented
his difficulties.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these circumstances we may learn, that the
Athenian government was by no means penurious
in its appropriation of those funds which the contributions
of the wealthier citizens placed at its
disposal.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the amount of the daily allowance writers are
not agreed, some pretending it was three oboli, others
two, and others an obolos. The truth, probably, is,
that, originally, it exceeded not a single obolos, but
that, as prices augmented, or, rather, as the coin deteriorated
in value, it was found necessary to double
the amount.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c014'><sup>[285]</sup></a> Whether it was ever raised to three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>oboli seems doubtful; the affirmation of the Scholiast
on Æschines<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c014'><sup>[286]</sup></a> may be a mistake; but the mere
fact that this was the pay of the dicasts is no reason
at all for calling the testimony of the grammarian
in question.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c014'><sup>[287]</sup></a> Be this, however, as it may, in the
time of Lysias,<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c014'><sup>[288]</sup></a> one obolos only was bestowed, and
Bœckh has attempted, with much ingenuity, to determine
the date of the increased allowance. It had
not taken place, according to Harpocration, in the
time of Aristotle; but Philochoros, the next writer
who touches on the subject, observes, that it was
nine drachmæ a month, or fifty-four oboli,<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c014'><sup>[289]</sup></a> which,
omitting the fractions, is equal to two oboli a day.
The year in which Aristotle composed his treatise
on the Athenian government is not exactly known;
it was probably, however, after his return from Macedon,
334 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Philochoros was Hieroscopos at
Athens in the year of Corœbos, 306 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> He did
not, however, publish his Atthis till about the year
260 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, at which time the poor allowance had been
raised to two oboli. The date of the increase, therefore,
falls somewhere within the preceding seventy years.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c014'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>With respect to the number of persons blind, old,
sick, maimed, or otherwise disabled, who received
maintenance from the state, no exact computation
can be made. Bœckh,<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c014'><sup>[291]</sup></a> imagining that Meursius
had reckoned them at five hundred, after remarking
that the assumption is founded on a false reading
in Suidas, accepts the number as the least that can
be adopted. But Meursius,<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c014'><sup>[292]</sup></a> in the passage referred
to, assumes nothing; he does not even allude to the
number at all. And, in fact, it will be evident, at
the first glance, that no conjecture can hope to approach
the truth where circumstances were constantly
varying, adding to, or taking from, the number
of those who required relief. This was chiefly
affected by the general poverty of the state, which augmented
rapidly towards its decline, when the number
of the aged and infirm, not possessing three
minæ, or twelve pounds sterling, per annum, must,
no doubt, have been considerable. On the other
hand, having no longer to defend its freedom, which
was gone for ever, the children of citizens falling
in battle were comparatively few, and, accordingly,
the gain on this item went to balance the loss on
the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>The offspring of citizens thus bequeathed to the
care of the state were at one time exceedingly
numerous, and highly exemplary and honourable was
the attention they received.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c014'><sup>[293]</sup></a> To the females a maintenance,
education, and a portion, were given; and
the males having also been supported and educated
until manhood, received in the public theatre a complete
suit of armour, as a memento of their fathers’
valour, to incite them to follow their example. The
whole audience being assembled, the herald introduced
the orphan youths clothed in panoply of
“complete steel,” and then, with a loud voice, proclaimed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>what Æschines rightly regarded as a most
glorious and valour-inspiring proclamation, viz., that
the fathers of those youths, like brave and good
men, had fallen in their country’s battles, on which
account the state had undertaken the charge of
their bringing up, and now, on the verge of manhood,
having adorned them with an entire suit of
armour, dismissed them under happy auspices to
watch over their own affairs, granting them, likewise,
for the day, the most honourable seats in the
theatre.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c014'><sup>[294]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Petit<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c014'><sup>[295]</sup></a> supposes this to have taken place on their
attaining the age of twenty, before which they could
not legally assume the management of their inheritance,
or encounter the fatigue and peril of regular
warfare; but, others, perhaps, with more probability,
fix upon the age of eighteen.</p>

<p class='c001'>The above legal provision, however, does not appear
to have sufficed, and there sometimes occurred
cases of distress which it could not reach. Many,
too, would submit to great privation rather than
have recourse to public aid. Such persons, where
numbers were in similar circumstances, usually united
and formed, what may very properly be denominated
a Benefit Club (ἔρανος<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c014'><sup>[296]</sup></a>), to which they contributed
when in their power, that, should misfortune overtake
them, they might still be sure of support.
This description, however, of Eranos constituted
only one branch of the numerous Clubs, Companies,
Associations, Trades-unions, &amp;c., which, like the
Clubs of the Civil Wars<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c014'><sup>[297]</sup></a> and Associations of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>still later date, occasionally assumed a political character
and impeded the movements of the machinery
of the state.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c014'><sup>[298]</sup></a> These societies were instituted
with various objects. In the first place they were
established to defray by subscription the expense
of certain sacrifices, offered up in behalf of their
members who were called Eranistæ and Thiasotæ.
But under cover of this pretext combinations of
an evil tendency were sometimes formed,—among
the aristocracy, for example, who established the
tyranny of the Four Hundred,—and these obnoxious
clubs, varying in character with the period, espoused
the cause of freedom in Roman times, and were of
course watched jealously by the conquerors.<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c014'><sup>[299]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to those associations which bore a
legal character, they were by the laws of Solon
permitted to enact whatever rules and regulations
they judged proper for their own government and
advantage, provided no public ordinance prevented.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c014'><sup>[300]</sup></a>
Sometimes the citizens of a whole Demos, or borough,
formed themselves into a club, or a ship’s
crew,<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c014'><sup>[301]</sup></a> or an eating society, or persons having a
right to the same burial-ground, or the partners
in a mercantile expedition. Thus we find three
several motives,—religion, gain, and pleasure,—impelling
men into unions of this kind, all recognised
by law. The curious and intricate internal
structure of Athenian society lent itself readily to
the formation of such clubs; the whole population
having originally been divided into four tribes, each
tribe into three phratriæ,<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c014'><sup>[302]</sup></a> each phratria into thirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>clans (γενη), each clan containing thirty houses, among
whom the honours of the priesthood were distributed
by lot.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c014'><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In these Attic associations we discover the germs
of those companies of merchants, guilds, &amp;c.,<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c014'><sup>[304]</sup></a> so
familiar to the modern world; or rather similar
wants in both cases gave rise to similar institutions.
But with the trading companies we have, in this
place, nothing to do; and if incidentally the other
associations are noticed, it is simply for the purpose
of more fully developing a system of which the Benefit
Clubs formed a part. These evidently rose
out of the Eranæ established originally for purposes
of pleasure: that is, a number of individuals desirous
of enjoying a more splendid entertainment
than they could generally afford at home,<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c014'><sup>[305]</sup></a> together
with the society of their intimate friends, entered
into a subscription<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c014'><sup>[306]</sup></a> for the purpose of getting up a
public dinner during the celebration of the great
national festivals. In some cases the associations
thus formed, pro tempore, did not outlast the occasion,
while in others the taste for social pleasures,
or the accidental meeting of congenial tempers, led
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>to the establishment of a permanent club, the members
of which grew naturally among a warm-hearted
people to take an interest in each other’s welfare.
The expenses of the sacrifices during these festivals
were in part defrayed from the revenues of the sacred
lands, but these not sufficing, it was generally
necessary to raise a common fund by subscription.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c014'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of all these clubs, whether temporary or permanent,
whose object was the providing of funds for
sacrifice, or to enjoy the pleasures of society, the
generic name was <em>Erani</em>, though such as partook
of a religious character received besides the appellation
of <em>Thiasi</em>.<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c014'><sup>[308]</sup></a> Their members were called
Eranistæ and Thiasotæ. It was common among
the Greeks to indulge in feasting immediately at
the close of harvest, both on account of the plenty
which then prevailed, and, because the great business
of the year being finished, they had more leisure to
devote to enjoyment.<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c014'><sup>[309]</sup></a> That these associations tended
to generate and promote friendship and affection
among their members was well understood; wherefore
in the ancient tyrannies they were rigidly prohibited,
together with all common tables, educational
establishments, and whatever else, to adopt the expression
of Aristotle, promotes reflection and mutual
confidence.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c014'><sup>[310]</sup></a> It was supposed to be their interest
to keep men as far as possible in ignorance and
distrust of each other. Hence all religions with a
tendency to beget mutual love were proscribed (as
among the Romans Christianity) as of an antimonarchical
character. Thus Mæcenas, as ardent a patron
of tyranny as of literature, urged Augustus to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>persecute and proscribe all attempts at introducing
new creeds, as favourable to innovation or, at least,
to change; to sworn brotherhoods, associations, clubs,
things in their nature hostile to monarchy.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c014'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The conjecture is probable, that the conversion
of the Erani into charitable institutions was matter
of accident. At first it seems clear, as I have
observed already, that their object was sacrifice,
feasting, and pleasure. But it sometimes happened
that, of the funds subscribed, some portion would,
after their objects had been fulfilled, remain; and
if, when this was the case, any member of the club
happened to fall into distress, it was perfectly natural
to think of applying this surplus to his benefit.<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c014'><sup>[312]</sup></a>
From this the step was easy to subscribing expressly
for the purpose of relieving indigent members,
which, at length, was the practice, though the
gradations by which they arrived at it have not
been accurately marked.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c014'><sup>[313]</sup></a> Arrian has left a curious
account of a Celtic eranos established by a Hunting
Club in honour of Artemis,<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c014'><sup>[314]</sup></a> to whom solemn
sacrifice was annually offered up. A fund was created
by the members of the club in the following
manner: every one who caught a hare paid into
the treasury two oboli: the capturer or destroyer
of a fox a drachma, the fox being a mischievous
animal and fatal to the hare; they therefore considered
his destruction in the light of a triumph
over an enemy. The sportsman who took a roebuck
(δορκὰς), which among them was the noblest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>game, and the largest animal hunted, paid four
drachmæ. On the birth-day of the goddess the
treasury was opened, and a victim, whether a sheep,
a she-goat, or a calf, according to their means,
was purchased. Sacrifice was then offered, after
which both men and dogs regaled themselves with
a banquet. Bitches were on this day crowned with
flowers, to show that the feast was celebrated in
their behalf.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c014'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In all these clubs the chest was the soul of everything;
for this being removed the whole society
fell to pieces.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c014'><sup>[316]</sup></a> Accordingly, to become a member
it was necessary to subscribe a certain amount to
the fund, and all payments were made monthly.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c014'><sup>[317]</sup></a> As
these clubs, moreover, were legal, the person who
neglected such payments could be prosecuted at law,
as for any other debt; and what shows the importance
of these institutions at Athens, the ordinances
referring to them formed a separate branch of jurisprudence,<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c014'><sup>[318]</sup></a>
to enter into which, however, does not
belong to my present inquiry. The president or
chairman of the club was likewise treasurer, whether
chosen by lot or elected by the members of the
club, whose expenses and behaviour, while assembled,
he appears to have regulated.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c014'><sup>[319]</sup></a> It has been seen
that the meetings of these societies took place during
religious festivals; but whenever they were called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>together, whether by business or piety, it was customary,
as in all similar cases among ourselves, for
the members to dine together. They do not appear,
however, to have possessed club-houses; but, like
our literary men of the last century, to have dined
at taverns or alternately at each others’ dwellings.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c014'><sup>[320]</sup></a>
On these occasions it was customary to restrain their
expenses within moderate limits, the object being
rather the enjoyment of each others’ society than
the indulgence of a passion for luxury.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c014'><sup>[321]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On those occasions, when a member received the
club at his house, he himself, it has been conjectured,
took the chair,<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c014'><sup>[322]</sup></a> not, however, necessarily and
by rule; for it has been seen that the president
was sometimes chosen by lot, sometimes by vote.
But this supposition is, probably, ill-founded; for,
as the same individual was at once eranarch and
treasurer, it appears exceedingly improbable that he
should be changed every time the club dined together.
It seems to me more likely,—and we are
left to conjecture,—that an annual chairman was
chosen to transact the general business of the society,
while another individual might be selected to fill the
office of chairman for any particular evening. Towards
the close of the republic, when the worship
of Serapis had been introduced, women would seem
to have been received as members of Erani established
in honour of that foreign divinity.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c014'><sup>[323]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But as these clubs were only accidentally connected
with charity and the condition of the poor,
I proceed to consider another species of Eranæ, conceived
almost in the spirit of Christianity. Van
Holst,<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c014'><sup>[324]</sup></a> whose researches on the subject of the Hellenic
clubs, though pedantic and confused, are not
without value, denies that any permanent charitable
associations existed among the Greeks, though among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the Romans, he conceives, they did. At the same
time, he confesses what it were difficult to deny,
that the friendly subscription called Eranos derived
its name and being from the clubs above-described.
He contends that no club existed with permanent
funds for the relief of distressed friends, and that
the relief actually afforded was the spontaneous effort
of beneficence and humanity. On this point he is
at issue with Casaubon,<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c014'><sup>[325]</sup></a> whom he appears, in some
respects, to misunderstand. Salmasius, he conceives,
comes nearer the mark where he says, that when
any person was overwhelmed with debt or poverty,
he found a ready refuge in his friends, who subscribed
what they could, both to satisfy his creditors
and provide for his future subsistence. It was in
the discharge of debts, however, that men found
most aid from their friends;<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c014'><sup>[326]</sup></a> though such subscriptions
were set on foot on many other occasions, to
redeem a man from captivity, for example, or to
portion a friendless girl, as was the practice also at
Thebes.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c014'><sup>[327]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The mode in which this subscription was collected,
and the principle on which the transaction was
based, had something characteristic about them. In
the first place, the money resembled a loan (which,
strictly speaking, it was not), because, if the receiver
afterwards became fortunate, he was bound to make
repayment,<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c014'><sup>[328]</sup></a> though while in unfavourable circumstances
his mind was not oppressed by the consciousness
of being in debt, since no one regarded himself
as a creditor, or could ask him for an obolos. Salmasius
observes very justly, that the greatest proof
of generosity is to give without any desire of a return,
which the Greeks called eleëmosynè, or eranos of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>strict charity. The second grade is, where money
is lent to be repaid without interest, which our
Saviour calls τὰ ἶσα ἀπολαβεῖν.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c014'><sup>[329]</sup></a> The lowest, where
you lend, but on condition of receiving interest.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c014'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>For the repayment of money collected by eranistic
subscription, no exact time, it has been observed,
was fixed. It appears to have depended entirely on
the recipient’s sense of honour or feelings of gratitude.
But Petit,<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c014'><sup>[331]</sup></a> whose researches on this part
of his subject were not sufficiently exact, confounds
the monthly subscription paid by members of a trading
company or ordinary club, with the money which
a man, aided by his friends, might be supposed to
owe them, and says, that such-a-one was required
to pay it back by monthly instalments, or all at
once within a month. The former would be the
case were we to understand Harpocration to speak
of this kind of eranos at all; the latter, if we accept
his interpretation. But Van Holst<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c014'><sup>[332]</sup></a> is right in
remarking that Petit here apprehends the sense of
the grammarian “minus recte”; that is, he mistakes
it altogether. However, that the money was at some
time to be repaid appears from a variety of passages.
Theophrastus, for example, in his Chapter on Grumbling,
observes, that the querulous man, to whom a
collection made for him by his friends is brought,
will reply to the person who bids him to be of good
cheer,—“Wherefore? when I must return as much
to each of them, and be grateful, moreover, for
the favour?”<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c014'><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the other peculiarities in the construction
of Athenian society which tended to better the condition
of the poor, were the entertainments given by
rich citizens to their tribes, on certain festivals or
days of public rejoicing.<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c014'><sup>[334]</sup></a> And this was a matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>by no means left to the caprice of individuals, for
if some one came not forward voluntarily to undergo
the expense, the members of the tribe proceeded
to cast lots,<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c014'><sup>[335]</sup></a> and the citizen to whose chance it
fell could not escape the performance of this duty,
unless he pleaded, as his excuse, some cause deemed
satisfactory by the public. Of course, the character
of the entertainment depended on the wealth or
munificence of the Hestiator.<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c014'><sup>[336]</sup></a> Necessary, it was not,
that he should regale his fellow-tribesmen sumptuously,
as frugality was one of the characteristics of the
nation; but, at the same time, it is quite evident
that on many occasions<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c014'><sup>[337]</sup></a> the Feast of the Tribe was
a magnificent banquet.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c014'><sup>[338]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of the state of the poor at Sparta,<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c014'><sup>[339]</sup></a> our information
is exceedingly scanty. We only know that,
when they were unable to contribute their share to
the maintenance of the public tables, they lost the
privilege of being present, and had to provide for
themselves at home in the best manner they were
able.<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c014'><sup>[340]</sup></a> It would thus appear that their Phiditia differred
very little, except in being more general,
from the Erani of the Athenians. As Laconia
abounded with game, it may be conjectured that the
more indigent citizens frequently relied greatly for
support on the chase,<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c014'><sup>[341]</sup></a> to which may be added the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>charity of their wealthier neighbours, in whatever
way bestowed. In Crete, the citizens being placed
more upon an equality, there was little room for
extreme poverty.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c014'><sup>[342]</sup></a> The population, moreover, by artificial
restraints, was kept within due bounds; consequently,
most persons lived plentifully, and possessed
wherewith to exercise the most generous
hospitality. But even here they multiplied in later
times more rapidly than the means of subsistence,
so that numbers of Cretans were fain to serve as
mercenary archers in the intestine wars of Greece.
The same remark will apply to the Arcadians, and
several other people whose poorer members earned
a subsistence by their hereditary valour.<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c014'><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At Athens, when persons in easy circumstances
made a feast, as on all occasions of sacrificing they
did, the custom was to send some small presents,
as parts of the victim, to their friends, more especially
when poor.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c014'><sup>[344]</sup></a> But most joyful for the indigent
was the period of the Athenian jubilee, the
Panathenaia,<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c014'><sup>[345]</sup></a> on which occasion the state received
presents of oxen from all the colonies founded by
Athenians, so that the whole city overflowed with
meat and soup, of which every person might take
his share. Sometimes, however, if not generally,
the meat fell into the hands of those who least
needed it, while the poor got nothing but a little
soup with a scanty slice of bread.<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c014'><sup>[346]</sup></a> In times of great
scarcity corn was distributed to the indigent in the
Odeion, where, on ordinary occasions, it was sold.<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c014'><sup>[347]</sup></a>
A similar distribution took place at the Peiræeus in
the arsenal, where loaves were given out at an obolos
each. On extraordinary occasions, as when a famine
raged in the country, the state applied for corn to
its foreign allies, and, on receiving any, distributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>it equally among the citizens. This was the case
when Psammitichos made the Athenians a present
of a vast quantity of wheat, of which every citizen
received five medimni.<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c014'><sup>[348]</sup></a> A peculiar kind of windfall
is commemorated by Athenæus, who relates, that
when Ion, the dramatic poet of Chios, won the prize
of tragedy, he was so overjoyed at his success, that
he presented every Athenian with a jar of the best
Chian. No doubt, foreign tragedians were not every
day winning prizes, or, when they won, so rich and
generous as Ion; but advantages of various kinds
were enjoyed by the Athenian people not anywhere
else known.<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c014'><sup>[349]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes, when generals obtained any remarkable
quantity of plunder, instead of laying it up to
meet the serious exigencies of the state they lavished
it in feasting the people. Thus, Chares is said to
have expended more than sixty talents, or near
15,000<i>l.</i> sterling in entertaining his fellow-citizens,<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c014'><sup>[350]</sup></a>
when the public tables were laid out in the agora;
and Conon,<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c014'><sup>[351]</sup></a> having obtained a great naval victory
over the Lacedæmonians at Cnidos, and surrounded
the Peiræeus with fortifications, offered a real hecatomb
in sacrifice, and feasted the whole body of
people. Of these thoughtless donations the poor,
of course, obtained their share. Cimon acted more
judiciously and more nobly towards the unfortunate
among his countrymen. Looking upon wealth only
as a means of recommending himself and obtaining
friends, he set no guard upon his lands or gardens,
from which every Athenian who chose might freely
take what he needed. His house, likewise, in the
city was open to all; a plain table being constantly
laid for a number of men, so that whosoever was
at a loss for a dinner might dine there. He willingly
obliged those who came daily to demand some
favour of him; and is said always to have gone

money, who were instructed to give to any citizen
who approached him with a request. He contributed
also to the interment of many; and, often,
if he observed a poor Athenian meanly clad, ordered
one of his attendants to change raiment with
him. By these means, as may be supposed, he acquired
marvellous popularity, and stood first among
his rivals in public estimation.<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c014'><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But persons thus subsisting on the bounty of the
opulent soon lost of necessity the dignity of sentiment
which should belong to the citizens of a free
state. Many, therefore, when reduced by misfortune,
to a choice of evils, preferred the bread obtained by
honest labour,<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c014'><sup>[353]</sup></a> however mean or ill paid, to so humiliating
a dependance on charity; and, unable to obtain
more favourable conditions, actually worked for
their food.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c014'><sup>[354]</sup></a> To labour for hire they scarcely accounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>a hardship. A large class of citizens, including
women,<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c014'><sup>[355]</sup></a> appear by this means to have gained
their livelihood, some as cooks, others as reapers,
mowers, or any other description of labour which
happened to offer itself.<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c014'><sup>[356]</sup></a> Poverty sometimes drove
the unprincipled poor to keep houses of ill fame.
Others became itinerant flower-sellers, and cried
“roses so many bunches the obolos;” or hawked
radishes, lupines, or olive-dregs about the streets.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c014'><sup>[357]</sup></a>
And, after their death, the daughters of poor men
sometimes joined the Hetairæ, not having been able
to earn their livelihood by needlework, weaving, and
spinning.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c014'><sup>[358]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In many respects the poor of southern climates
have the advantage of those of the north.<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c014'><sup>[359]</sup></a> The
atmosphere itself forms their clothing, and during
a great part of the year it is immaterial to them
where they sleep. But at Athens, however temperate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the climate, a shelter from the cold in winter
is desirable, and here, therefore, as in every
other part of Greece, the practice was to erect
houses where, as in the Caravanserais of the East,
any man, native or stranger, might enter and obtain
shelter for the night. These buildings were called
Leschæ, erected without doors, to intimate that all
were welcome; and in them, accordingly, beggars
and wanderers of every description congregated round
great fires in winter and bad weather, both to sleep
and converse.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c014'><sup>[360]</sup></a> Even the citizens, particularly at
Sparta, met in the Leschæ, to enjoy the delights
of gossiping; whence any idle assemblage was called
a Leschè.<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c014'><sup>[361]</sup></a> In a fragment of the lost oration
of Antiphon against Nicoles, mention is made of
these edifices, which served as a refuge for the destitute.
They were erected by the state; and, to
cast over them an air of sanctity, dedicated to
Apollo, who thence obtained the surname of Leschenorios.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c014'><sup>[362]</sup></a>
Nowhere were these humane institutions
so numerous as at Athens, where, according
to Proclus,<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c014'><sup>[363]</sup></a> there existed no fewer than three hundred
and sixty, in which the indigent, who had no
home, might congregate together and keep themselves
warm at the nation’s expense.</p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to these the public baths served as an
asylum to such of the poor as had no home, or were
unable to provide themselves with fuel in their own
dwellings. Here they would seem to have pressed
so eagerly about the furnaces as to be sometimes
scorched and blistered;<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c014'><sup>[364]</sup></a> and the crowd of poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>wretches in this necessitous condition would appear
to have been occasionally so great as to deteriorate
the state of the atmosphere by their breath,<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c014'><sup>[365]</sup></a> on
which account they were exposed to be driven forth
by the bath-keepers.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Homeric times, beggars and all other sorts of
vagrants took refuge from the nightly cold in smiths’
forges,<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c014'><sup>[366]</sup></a> just as in former ages they did in the glass-houses
of London. These fathers of sacrilege, as
Plato<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c014'><sup>[367]</sup></a> calls them, when properly equipped for the
road, presented a tolerably picturesque aspect with
their close Mysian bonnet,<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c014'><sup>[368]</sup></a> ragged cloak, and bottle
strapped to the thigh,<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c014'><sup>[369]</sup></a> and supporting themselves
as they walked on a huge staff. To this worshipful
society Dionysios, once tyrant of Syracuse, belonged
in his old age.<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c014'><sup>[370]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>There was at Athens, in later times, a class of
men who resembled the bone-grubbers and dung-hill
scrapers of London and Paris. These were the
grain-pickers of the Deigma and Agora, who hovering
about where the farmers and corn-chandlers
meted their grain, and collecting what dropped
from the sacks,<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c014'><sup>[371]</sup></a> or was spilled in measuring, thus
earned a miserable subsistence. Persons of this description
might eke out their livelihood by appropriating
to themselves the coarse brown bread which
pious and charitable persons placed in the propylæa
of temples for their use.<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c014'><sup>[372]</sup></a> Here Diogenes, the Cynic,
who, carrying about provisions in his wallet,
was independent of these offerings, sometimes dined;
and, for the sake of uttering a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bon mot</i></span>, threw out
the loaves that might have been useful to others;
observing, that nothing coarse<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c014'><sup>[373]</sup></a> should be allowed
to enter the temples of the gods.</p>

<p class='c001'>Religion has everywhere been favourable to the
poor. On the festival of the new moon, when the
great and opulent offered up costly sacrifices to the
gods, as to Hecatè, for example, on cross-roads,<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c014'><sup>[374]</sup></a>
their more indigent brethren seized the occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>when their hearts were thus softened, to ask them
for something. Thus Homer, according to the legend
attributed to Herodotus, went in Samos to the houses
of the wealthy, chanting his Eiresione, for which he
received a consideration.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c014'><sup>[375]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There was a class of beggars who went about
the country begging for the crow,<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c014'><sup>[376]</sup></a> holding, apparently,
a tame bird of that species like a falcon on
their wrist, and chanting the following ditty:—</p>

<p class='c016'>It was seldom, however, that the indigent in Greece
could enjoy the luxuries here enumerated. Antiphanes<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c014'><sup>[378]</sup></a>
describes a poor man’s meal as consisting of
a cake (μαζα),<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c014'><sup>[379]</sup></a> bristling with bran for the sake of
economy, with an onion, and, for a relish, a dish
of sow-thistle, or of mushrooms, or some such wretched
produce of the soil, a diet producing neither fever
nor phlegm. However, where meat is to be got,
no man, he thought, would be contented with thyme,
though he might pretend to rival the Pythagoreans.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c014'><sup>[380]</sup></a>
Mention, nevertheless, is made of two
philosophers who voluntarily subsisted all their lives
on water and figs, and grew very healthy and robust
upon this fare, though their perspiration had so ill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>an odour, that every one avoided them when they
entered the public baths. Pythagoras forbade his
abstemious followers the use of the mallows, upon
which the humbler classes in Greece were accustomed
to feed, together with the roots of the day-lily,
the nymphea nelumbo, the nettle,<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c014'><sup>[381]</sup></a> and various
other wild plants. The Kapparis,<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c014'><sup>[382]</sup></a> plentiful in Athens,

21. At times it would appear
a man required some skill and
eloquence to plead his own cause;
or a friend to speak in his behalf,
perhaps, when the number of applicants
was very great. We
may gather thus much from the
accusation of Æschines against
Timarchos, who, though a rich
man, suffered, we are told, his
old blind uncle to inscribe his
name on the list of the destitute.
On one occasion, moreover, when
the uncle had omitted to attend
on the proper day, and had addressed
a petition to the Senate
to be allowed his pay notwithstanding,
Timarchos, who happened
to be then in court, refused
to support his application,
by which means he lost his allowance
for that Prytaneia. Æschin.

This he states on the authority
of Suidas. But, as Siebelis has
already remarked, in exposing the
erroneous imputations of Vossius
and Corsini, Suidas was himself
mistaken, or his text is corrupt;
for Philochoros, to have obtained
the important office of Hieroscopos

labour to the poor, Plato says:—If
an artisan happen to fall sick,
he demands a rapid cure of his
physician by emetics or aperients,
or cautery, or surgical operation.
But if he be recommended a long
and careful attention to regimen,
to tie up his head and such
things, he speedily replies, that
he has no leisure to play the
valetudinarian, and that it is of
no advantage to him to preserve
his life by such continual nursings,
while his affairs are going
to ruin. Thus dismissing his
physician, and returning to his
ordinary diet, if he recover he
pursues his calling, if not he is
delivered from all his troubles at
once. De Repub. t. vi. l. iii. p.

of Halicarnassus entertained a
strange notion of the θῆτες and
πελάται of the Athenians, whose
condition he supposes to have
been inferior to that of the Roman
clients. He pretends, indeed,
that clientship arose in
Greece, and was only established
by imitation at Rome: ἔθος
Ἑλληνικὸν καὶ Ἀρχαῖον, he says,
ὧ Θετταλοί τε μέχρι πολλοῦ
χρώμενοι διετέλεσαν καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι
καταρχὰς. ἐκεῖνοι μὲν γὰρ
ἐπιτάττοντες οὐ προσήκοντα ἐλευθέροις,
καὶ ὁπότε μὴ πράξειάν τι
τῶν κελευρομένων, πληγὰς ἐντείνοντες,
καὶ τἄλλα ὥσπερ ἀργυρωνήτοις
χρώμενοι. ἐκάλουν
δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι μὲν Θῆτας τοὺς Πελάτας,
ἐπὶ τῆς λατρείας Θετταλοὶ
δὲ, Πενέστας, ὀνειδίζοντες αὐτοῖς
εὐθὺς ἐν τῇ κλήσει τὴν τύχην.
Antiq. Rom. ii. 9. Reiske very
justly remarks on this passage,
that he does not see with what
propriety the Thetes of Attica
are classed with the Thessalian
Penestæ, in comparing them with
the Roman Clients. For it is
most certain (as H. Stephens
shows in his Schediasm. v. 15,
seq.), that the condition of the
Penestæ bore little resemblance
to that of the Roman Clients.
And as to the Attic Thetes and
Pelatæ they were completely
free, though inferior in rank to
the artisans (οἱ βαναυσοὶ, Steph.
Thes. v. θῆς); nor did they
serve as slaves serve their masters
(ut δοῦλοι δεσπόταις); but, as
appears from the Scholiast on
Odyss. δ. 644, as poor and debt-oppressed
persons hire their services
to the rich or to their creditors,
who were denominated
χρήστας, not προστάτας, or δεσπότας.
The condition of the
Thessalian Penestæ was different:
for they were nearly slaves,
μεταξὺ δούλων καὶ ἐλευθέρων, as
the ancients called them. (Pollux,
iii. 83.) Those among them
who served in families were
named θετταλοικέται. (Reiske,

  <h3 id='ch6.2' class='c012'>CHAPTER II. <br /> INDUSTRY: MILLERS, BAKERS, VINTNERS, MARKETS, ETC.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We have examined the condition of the poor at
Athens, and shall now consider how far the laws
of the state interfered to better their circumstances
by promoting industry, and rendering it
honourable. Among the Spartans, idleness, the
vice of soldiers,<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c014'><sup>[389]</sup></a> was regarded as a proof of rank;
whence the remark of that disciple of Lycurgus,
who, being present at Athens during a trial for
this offence, fatal to a democracy, observed, that
they punished the man for being a gentleman.<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c014'><sup>[390]</sup></a>
Solon, however, entertained little respect for this
mark of gentility. According to his laws, of which
the whole design was to create and preserve that
feeling of manliness bestowed by the consciousness
of independence, the individual, who, possessing
no property, refused to labour, was a bad citizen,
against whom any one might bring an action of
idleness.<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c014'><sup>[391]</sup></a> Draco, the most Utopian and savage of
legislators, punished vagabondage with death, or, according
to some, with infamy only. But Solon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>who would not require too much of human nature,
reserved this latter penalty for those who should
be thrice convicted.<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c014'><sup>[392]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It has been conjectured, that Peisistratos was
author of the law against idleness; by which he
sought to compel as many of the citizens as had
no visible means of support, to take refuge in the
country. Be this, however, as it may, it was not
alone by severity, that the laws of Athens sought
to recommend the pursuits of industry.<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c014'><sup>[393]</sup></a> Superior
excellence in any useful art entitled a man to very
high honours, to maintenance at the public expense,
in the Prytaneion, in company with the chief magistrates
and generals of the commonwealth, and
one of the first seats at all spectacles and popular
assemblies. But to preserve this post, it was not
enough to have once done well. The ambitious
citizen could maintain it only by persevering in the
career of invention and improvement, for if another
man in the same line were judged to excel him, he
relinquished to the new comer both his dinners and
his seat.<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c014'><sup>[394]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>From this, and other circumstances, it would appear,
that there were annual exhibitions of works of
art and industry, in principle like our cattle-shows,
when a careful scrutiny of every improvement and
invention took place, and the premium above described
was awarded to the most ingenious. It is
very certain that an assembly of the trades, more
particularly of the bright-smiths, took place, on the
thirtieth of Pyanepsion, in honour of Hephæstos, or
Athena, when the festival of Pandemon, or Chalkeia,
was celebrated; and the conjecture of Petit<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c014'><sup>[395]</sup></a> is not
improbable, that δεῖξις, or exhibition, then took
place. It was, perhaps, on the same occasion, that
the Athenian potters exhibited their most beautiful
works and models.<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c014'><sup>[396]</sup></a> At Sybaris, the author of any
invention in the art of cookery enjoyed by patent,
during the whole year, a monopoly of the article;
and in the same city, the dyers and importers of
purple, as well as those who caught and sold eels,
were exempted from all taxes and imposts.<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c014'><sup>[397]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A further incitement to industry, and the apprenticing
out of children, was the law which freed
any one who had not been instructed in some trade,
from the necessity of supporting his parents,<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c014'><sup>[398]</sup></a> to
which otherwise all persons were strictly bound.
Another law of Solon, which, at the same time
shows the erroneousness of the common opinion
respecting the condition of women at Athens, proves
that to bring industry into good repute was a work
of some difficulty. By this it was enacted, that any
individual who reproached a citizen, whether male
or female, with carrying on any business in the
Agora, should be liable to a penalty.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c014'><sup>[399]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There were, however, certain callings which the
laws considered disreputable, or, at least, unsuitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>to a man. Thus, an Athenian citizen could not
legally be a perfumer, that effeminate vocation being
left to the women.<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c014'><sup>[400]</sup></a> Fishmongers, too, with butchers,
cooks, sausage-sellers, fishermen, were held in low
estimation both at Rome and Athens. Of all these
Attic <em>pariahs</em>, however, the poor wretch who hawked
fish,<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c014'><sup>[401]</sup></a> and was contemptuously said to wipe his nose
in his sleeve, or with his elbow, engrossed the largest
share of public scorn. To these we may add bird-catchers,
and fruit-sellers, and those low black-legs
who subsisted on gambling.<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c014'><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As an encouragement to the citizens to addict
themselves to industrious pursuits, foreigners, and
all persons not free of the city, were legally incapacitated
from carrying on business in the agora;<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c014'><sup>[403]</sup></a>
but this came in later times to be disregarded, since
we find Egyptians, Phœnicians, and other aliens,
possessing shops, and growing rich there. It was
conceived, moreover, that, if men confined themselves
to one calling, they would arrive therein at
greater excellence; and the law, accordingly, forbade
them to be of two trades.<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c014'><sup>[404]</sup></a> Plato, whose ideal
republic was modelled in so many particulars on
that of Athens, adopted this law; and for the reason
I have stated; comprehending thoroughly what
advantages arise from the division of labour. He
would not, he says, have the cordwainer meddle
with husbandry, weaving, or architecture, that he
might carry shoemaking to as great perfection as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>possible; and, in other branches of industry, men
were in like manner to cultivate that only for which
nature had fitted them, and wherein they might thus
excel.<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c014'><sup>[405]</sup></a> The same philosopher, while on the subject
of industry, makes a remark worthy of consideration:
It is not, he says, for the interest of the community,
that men engaged in any branch of the arts
should be so rich as to be independent of their
business or profession, which, in such case, they
will be apt to neglect; or so poor as to be harassed
in mind, or cramped in the means of carrying
on their occupations satisfactorily. In these
things, as in every other, a comfortable competence
is to be preferred to the extremes both of wealth
and poverty.<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c014'><sup>[406]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another means of carrying the various arts towards
perfection, which in India and Egypt prevailed
from time immemorial, is supposed to have
been a practice, whether founded on law or custom,
resembling the system of castes.<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c014'><sup>[407]</sup></a> Theories, not destitute
of ingenuity, have been constructed on this
view of Athenian society.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c014'><sup>[408]</sup></a> Thus, the Dædali are
supposed to have formed the sculptor caste; the
Eupyridæ a caste of husbandmen; the Boutadæ of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>herdsmen; the Ceryces of heralds; the Hephœstiadæ
of blacksmiths; the Poimenidæ of shepherds, and
so on. Vestiges of this curious state of things are
supposed to be discernible in the history of Attica,
even so late as the age of Pericles, when we find
Socrates a member of the Dædalian clan, by profession
a sculptor. There were certainly in religious
matters hereditary offices, which none could with propriety
fill but the members of a certain family or clan.
Thus, from among the Eteobutadæ was chosen the
priestess of Athena Polias, who resided in the temple
on the Acropolis; and the priest of Poseidon was
drawn by lot from the same house.<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c014'><sup>[409]</sup></a> To the Praxiergidæ
were entrusted certain duties about the statue
of Athena during the Plynterian festival.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c014'><sup>[410]</sup></a> The descendants
of Buzyges performed those sacred ceremonies
which thrice a year attended the ploughing
of the soil;<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c014'><sup>[411]</sup></a> to mention for the present no more.</p>

<p class='c001'>But we are not on this account to infer the existence
in Attica of anything like the Hindù system
of castes, which has itself never been rigidly observed.<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c014'><sup>[412]</sup></a>
What happens everywhere took place at Athens:
fathers generally found it more convenient to bring
up their sons to their own calling,<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c014'><sup>[413]</sup></a> while the latter,
observing constantly certain mechanical operations
take place under their eye, were led first to admire
and then to imitate. Thus the Potter’s boy, as
Plato<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c014'><sup>[414]</sup></a> remarks, long ministers to his father before
he takes the clay into his own hands and begins
to model a vase or tureen.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>At Sparta, the heralds, cooks, and flute-players,
constituted so many small castes, in which the profession
passed down regularly from father to son.
Of the absurdity of this practice Herodotus was fully
sensible, for he observes, that a man was chosen to
be a herald not for the loudness of his voice, but
because he was a herald’s son.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c014'><sup>[415]</sup></a> Upon the whole,
however, the practice was no more general among
the Greeks than it is in England. When it became
fashionable to ape gentility, rustic hinds, like Strepsiades
in the “Clouds,” found their sons ashamed of
the humble callings by which their childhood had
been supported; a passion for aristocratic distinction
infested the bosom of the vulgar; all desired to appear
what they were not; and, despite the wise
institutions of Solon, handicraftsmen and artificers
sunk into hopeless contempt.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c014'><sup>[416]</sup></a> For this reason most
trades by degrees were exercised by foreigners, who
frequently acquired wealth and independence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Notwithstanding this result, however, at which
they arrived but slowly, both manufactures and every
other branch of industry were in Greece, and at
Athens more particularly, carried to a very high
pitch of perfection. Even in the very lowest trades
the love of gain, or the necessity of somehow earning
a subsistence, led men to persevere. For example,
in the occupation of a common fisherman,
from which little beyond penury could be hoped
for, and which impressed upon the countenance that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>sordid aspect so successfully represented by Hellenic
art,<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c014'><sup>[417]</sup></a> there were always numbers ready to engage.
And yet consider in Theocritus<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c014'><sup>[418]</sup></a> their wretched life,
sleeping in their weather-beaten hut on the bleak
shore, amid heaps of nets, piscatory baskets, lines,
&amp;c., and there dreaming, as indigence often does,
of discovered treasures and ingots of gold. The
patient endurance of the hungry fishers, seated far
above the water on steep rocks, watching the entrance
of the huge prey into their nets, appears to
have been proverbial.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c014'><sup>[419]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the superior trades and manufactures there
was among several cities an emulation, the result
of which was to produce constant improvement.
Athens, for example, which excelled in pottery, had
rivals in Aulis, Rhodes, Megara, Corinth, Cnidos,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and several other cities; Sicily and Bœotia were
famous for their chariots; Argos for the manufacture
of arms; Thessaly for its easy chairs; Chios
and Miletos for their beds; Etruria for its gold-plate
and works in bronze.<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c014'><sup>[420]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is to be regretted that into the practice of the
several trades and useful arts we can see but a very
little way. In order, however, to render our idea
of Hellenic civilisation as complete as possible, I
shall here bring together as many particulars as I
have been able to discover on this subject, commencing
with those trades which were of primary
necessity.<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c014'><sup>[421]</sup></a> Of these, that of the miller may doubtless
be regarded as of the first importance. In
very early ages men understood not the art of reducing
corn into meal; but either roasted the unripe
ears upon the fire, or parched the separated
grains in small fryingpans.<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c014'><sup>[422]</sup></a> In process of time,
however, the pestle and mortar were invented, by
means of which,<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c014'><sup>[423]</sup></a> though at a great expense of labour,
flour of the finest possible quality could be
obtained. To these succeeded the handmill, an invention
of very remote ages,<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c014'><sup>[424]</sup></a> which, notwithstanding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>continued in use down to the days of Cicero.
This machine, both in Greece and Italy, was at
first commonly worked by women,<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c014'><sup>[425]</sup></a> more especially
by female slaves. But afterward the rudest and
worst conducted of the male domestics were condemned
to this severe toil, which at length grew
to be regarded in the light of a punishment,<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c014'><sup>[426]</sup></a> as
working at the treadmill with us. Among the
wealthy, each master of a family possessed his own
mill; but as civilisation advanced, the grinding of
corn constituted a separate occupation, and the trade
of the miller was established. Public mills<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c014'><sup>[427]</sup></a> were
common at Athens in the time of Socrates, and it
does not appear to have been unusual for strong
and sturdy men of free condition to labour for hire
in these establishments.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus we find that the philosophers Menedemos
and Asclepiades, when young and poor, earned their
subsistence, and were enabled to pursue the study of
philosophy, by working at night in a mill.<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c014'><sup>[428]</sup></a> As few
persons knew this circumstance, and they were observed
all day among the learned in the schools,
some one brought against them an accusation of idleness,
for which they were cited before the senate
of Areopagos. In order to prove that they gained
their livelihood in an honest way, the miller for whom
they worked was brought forward. His testimony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>confirmed their statement; and he added, moreover,
that he paid to each of them two drachmas per
night. The Areopagites were so pleased with this
proof of their industry and passion for philosophy,
that, on pronouncing their acquittal, they at the same
time made them a present of two hundred drachmas.<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c014'><sup>[429]</sup></a>
But these mills were not always put in motion by
the hand of man. Yoked to beams projecting from
the upper millstone, oxen and asses, moving about
in a circle, blindfold, as at present, when similarly
employed, sometimes turned the mill instead of
slaves.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c014'><sup>[430]</sup></a> Upon the construction of these machines
little exact information was possessed before the
laying open of the ruins of Pompeii, where, in a
baker’s shop, four mills, still almost perfect, have
been discovered. They consist of a round stone
basement with a rim, from the centre of which
springs a blunt cone: this is the nether millstone.
The upper one consists of an imperfect cylinder,
hollowed out within, like an hour-glass, one part of
which fits like a cap upon the cone below, while
the other expands its bell-mouth above. Into this
the corn was poured, and, descending through four
small apertures upon the nether stone, was, by the
turning round of the upper one thereon, reduced to
meal, which passed gradually down, fining as it went,
and fell out upon the stone basement below. The
corn having been ground, the next operation was,
to sever the flour from the bran, though sometimes
bread was made from it in the rough,<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c014'><sup>[431]</sup></a> and regarded,
moreover, as extremely wholesome. First, and most
simple of these contrivances, was the sieve,<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c014'><sup>[432]</sup></a> made
with slender rushes, which separated the coarse bran
and produced a meal sufficiently cleansed for household
bread. A much superior sieve was manufactured
with linen threads, by which the flour was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>bolted to a great degree of fineness. When it was
required of still superior purity and whiteness, the
bolter would seem to have been bottomed with
threads of woollen, which, being woven close, allowed
nothing but particles of the utmost tenuity to
pass.<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c014'><sup>[433]</sup></a> All the above operations were supposed to
be placed under the superintendence of a particular
deity named Eunostos,<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c014'><sup>[434]</sup></a> of whom no mention,
I believe, is made in modern systems of mythology.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ancients employed in the making of bread
a great many kinds of grain besides wheat<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c014'><sup>[435]</sup></a> and
barley;<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c014'><sup>[436]</sup></a> as rye, millet, which was little nourishing,
panic, which was still less so,<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c014'><sup>[437]</sup></a> sesame, olyra, spelt,
rice, tiphe, and a sort of grain from Ethiopia, called
orindion. Several other substances were likewise
used for the same purpose, not for the sake of adulteration,
but either to improve the taste, or from reasons
of economy; such as the root of the lotos,<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c014'><sup>[438]</sup></a> and,
perhaps, of the day-lily<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c014'><sup>[439]</sup></a> dried, and reduced, like
wheat itself, to flour; and the root of the corn-flag,<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c014'><sup>[440]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>which was previously boiled, and, for the sake of
communicating a sweet taste to the bread, would
appear to have been mixed with the dough as the
meal of the potato is in modern times. This plant
grew most plentifully in grounds frequented by the
mole, which loved to feed upon it. Another ingredient
often mixed with bread was, the pulpy
seed of the Star of Bethlehem,<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c014'><sup>[441]</sup></a> of which the root
likewise was eaten, both raw and cooked.</p>

<p class='c001'>The seed of the pepper-wort,<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c014'><sup>[442]</sup></a> also, was sprinkled
over cakes. Among the Thracians, about the river
Strymon, they made bread from the flour of the
water-caltron,<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c014'><sup>[443]</sup></a> a prickly root of a triangular form,
which abounds in the lagoons about Venice, where
it is sold commonly in the market-places, and roasted
for the table in hot embers.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c014'><sup>[444]</sup></a> The root of the
dragon-wort,<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c014'><sup>[445]</sup></a> eaten both raw and cooked in Greece,
was, in the Balearic isles, served up fried with honey
at banquets instead of cakes. They gathered it in harvest
time, and, having roasted, cut it in slices, which
were then strung on a cord and dried in the shade
for keeping. The seeds of the garden poppy were
used in bread-making, perhaps like carraway-seeds
with us, as were those of the wild poppy for medicinal
purposes in honeycakes, and certain kinds of
sweetmeats.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c014'><sup>[446]</sup></a> They had in Syria a kind of bread
made of mulberries, which caused the hair of those
who habitually fed on it to fall off.<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c014'><sup>[447]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Although in the establishments of the wealthy
bread was usually made by the women of the family,
whether servile or free, the art of the baker
seems early to have been practised as a separate
business,<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c014'><sup>[448]</sup></a> frequently at Athens by foreigners. The
Lydian bakers, for example,<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c014'><sup>[449]</sup></a> like those of France
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>and Germany among us, enjoyed considerable celebrity,
as did likewise the Cappadocians and Phœnicians,
the art of the last having been able, it is
said, to vary the qualities of the loaf every day in
the year.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c014'><sup>[450]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of the form and structure of a baker’s establishment
we may acquire some conception from the
ruins of Pompeii, where the mills, the ovens, the
kneading-troughs,<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c014'><sup>[451]</sup></a> small and great, would appear
to have been sometimes of stone, though generally,
perhaps, of wood. When the dough had been properly
kneaded and leavened,<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c014'><sup>[452]</sup></a> it was removed to a
table with a rim, and fashioned into a variety of
forms by the hand or with moulds. The larger
loaves were placed in rows in a capacious oven,
in which wood had been burnt and raked out carefully.
Sometimes, also, a fire would appear to have
been kept up in an open space round the oven,
having at the top a smoke vent. One kind of
loaf was baked in a small fictile or iron oven,
called cribanos,<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c014'><sup>[453]</sup></a> which was either placed on the fire,
or surrounded by hot coals. There was another
which they toasted before the fire on a spit;<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c014'><sup>[454]</sup></a> and
a great variety of cakes were baked on the live
coals, or in the ashes.<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c014'><sup>[455]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These it would require a separate treatise to enumerate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and describe, since fashion appears to have
been constantly varying the materials, the forms,
and the appellations, of loaves. Upon the whole,
however, the bread sold in the market-place of
Athens was esteemed the whitest and most delicious
in Greece; for the Rhodians, speaking partially of
the produce of their own ovens, supposed they were
bestowing on it the highest compliment when they
said it was not inferior to that of Athens.<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c014'><sup>[456]</sup></a> The dimensions
of loaves depended, of course, on the object of
the baker, and varied from those of the smallest roll,
prepared for people of delicate appetites, to those
of the enormous obeliæ, sometimes containing upwards
of three bushels of flour, borne in procession
at the festival of Dionysos.<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c014'><sup>[457]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The business of the confectioner was in scarcely
less request, or less profitable, than that of the baker
himself. In most cases, perhaps, the finer kinds of
pastry were made by women,<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c014'><sup>[458]</sup></a> whose taste and skill
enabled them to gratify the lovers of delicacies with
an infinite variety of sweetmeats. The vocabulary
connected with this division of the art culinary is
singularly rich, but, in many cases, conveys to our
minds very little precise information. It may be
inferred, however, with something like certainty,
that the stock of an Athenian confectioner contained
most of those delicious trifles now to be
found in the establishments of their successors in
London or Paris. It will, consequently, be impossible
to enumerate them, or to specify the several
ingredients which entered into their composition. It
has already, I believe, been observed, in speaking
of wine, that the ancients were exceedingly partial
to sweets, which, in the making of their confectionary,
led them to the constant employment of
honey. Most of their favourite cakes contained
some portion of this ingredient,<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c014'><sup>[459]</sup></a> sometimes, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>found in company with other articles apparently
little calculated to combine with it. Wine, too,
and cheese, and milk, and seeds, and the juices of
vegetables, entered into the composition of various
sweetmeats, which were occasionally made to keep
long, as when intended for exportation; occasionally
to be consumed at the moment, as they issued hot
from the oven or the fryingpan. To this latter class
belonged those delicate pancakes, the paste of which
was poured liquid into the fryingpan, then flooded
atop with fresh honey, and sprinkled with sesame
and grated cheese.<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c014'><sup>[460]</sup></a> The taste for the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>catillus ornatus</i></span>
the Greeks appear to have borrowed from the Romans.
This was a rich cake, composed of fine flour,
kneaded with lard and the juice of lettuces, pounded
in a mortar with wine, seasoned with pepper, and
fried in boiling oil.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c014'><sup>[461]</sup></a> Among their pastry was a sort
of pie made of vine-birds<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c014'><sup>[462]</sup></a> and beccaficoes,<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c014'><sup>[463]</sup></a> the
undercrust of which, kneaded with honey, was sometimes
moistened at table in chicken-broth.<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c014'><sup>[464]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These cakes and sweetmeats were sometimes
fashioned into very extraordinary forms; one sort,
for example, representing the female breast,<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c014'><sup>[465]</sup></a> another
a perfect sphere,<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c014'><sup>[466]</sup></a> a third the head and horns
of an ox,<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c014'><sup>[467]</sup></a> while others were wrought into mystical
figures, and appropriated to certain festivals of the
Pagan calendar. The cake called Chærinè, made
with the flour of parched wheat and honey, was
bestowed as a prize on those who, during the Pannuchia,
remained awake all night.<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c014'><sup>[468]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The trade of the butcher<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c014'><sup>[469]</sup></a> was carried on at
Athens by citizens,<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c014'><sup>[470]</sup></a> whose shops in the Agora
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>would seem to have been extremely well furnished,
containing every variety of meat, from the chine
of a prize ox,<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c014'><sup>[471]</sup></a> to the hind quarter of an ass.<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c014'><sup>[472]</sup></a>
Sheep’s and kids’ heads were commonly sought to
be rendered more attractive by having a branch of
myrtle stuck between the teeth, whence one of the
hetairæ was compared to a goat’s head, because she
often walked the street with a sprig of myrtle in
her mouth.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c014'><sup>[473]</sup></a> The information which antiquity has
left us respecting butchers’ shops and implements is
extremely imperfect. We are told simply, that they
had chopping-blocks and cleavers, large axes with
which animals were felled in the slaughter-houses,
flaying knives, hooks whereon to suspend and display
their stock, with scales for weighing meat.<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c014'><sup>[474]</sup></a>
A very curious anecdote is related of a Milesian
butcher: there was a man named Killicon, who
betrayed his native city Miletos, to the Prienians.
Among his countrymen, who on this occasion became
fugitives, was a butcher. This man fled to
Samos, where he carried on his old business.<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c014'><sup>[475]</sup></a> Some
time after Killicon himself came to that island, and
going into the market to buy provisions, by chance
addressed himself to the Milesian butcher, whose
name was Theagenes. The man remembered the
traitor, and when he would have bought of him a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>piece of meat, desired Killicon to lay hold of the
part he wanted, while he severed it from the carcase;
then taking up an axe he smote off his hand,
saying, “With that hand, at least, you shall never
again betray your country.”<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c014'><sup>[476]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The vintners and tavern-keepers, who were tolerably
numerous in Greece,<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c014'><sup>[477]</sup></a> appear to have acquired
much the same reputation as they enjoy in
modern times. It was regarded as a matter of some
difficulty to discover a jar of pure wine beneath
their roofs; and, indeed, the honest vine-growers
of the country are accused of having understood
the art of making Bacchos acquainted with the
nymphs on his way to the city. In other words
they sold from their waggons in the Agora<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c014'><sup>[478]</sup></a> a certain
quantity of the Ilissos, mingled with the juice
of the grape. The tavern-keepers, however, stood
in very little need of their assistance, since they
were not merely adepts in watering and doctoring
their wines, but were skilful at giving short measure;<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c014'><sup>[479]</sup></a>
and yet understood various contrivances for
alluring people to their houses. Thus one of them,
for example, used to present a club that dined at
his tavern with a kid,<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c014'><sup>[480]</sup></a> reckoning upon paying himself
by the profits of the wine.<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c014'><sup>[481]</sup></a> However, when
an opulent and delicate company honoured them
with their presence, they could, doubtless, supply
wines of the finest flavour; and to render them
still more delicious, they were accustomed in summer
to plunge the flagons into snow,<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c014'><sup>[482]</sup></a> or, occasionally,
to mingle it with the wine, as is still the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>fashion at Naples and in Sicily. Taverns, therefore,
were furnished with ice-cellars, where snow could
be kept during the hottest weather. Alexander<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c014'><sup>[483]</sup></a>
found means of carrying along with him a quantity
of this article of luxury into India, where he
probably treated Taxilos and Poros with iced wines.
This achievement was imitated many ages after by
the Khalif Mahadi, who on his pilgrimage to Mecca
traversed the desert accompanied by a numerous
train of camels laden with ice and snow, the first,
according to Oriental historians, ever beheld in the
Holy Cities. In the island of Cimolos, people made
use, as coolers, of deep pits, in which jars of soft
and tepid water,<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c014'><sup>[484]</sup></a> and, doubtless, wine also, were refrigerated.<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c014'><sup>[485]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The wine was laid up in jars, skins, and flasks,
which, like the oil-flasks of Florence and Lucca,
were cased with fine basket-work.<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c014'><sup>[486]</sup></a> The measures
in use were numerous, and somewhat difficult to be
reduced with exactness to those of modern times:
the metretes (ten gallons two pints) contained twelve
choes; the chous (about six pints) six xestæ; the
xestes (one pint) two cotylæ; the cotyla (half-pint)
two tetarti; the tetarton (one quartern) two oxybapha;
the oxybaphon, one cyathus and a-half;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the cyathus, two conchæ; the concha, two mystra;
the mystron, one chema and a-half; the chema,
two cochlearia.<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c014'><sup>[487]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting the price of wines<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c014'><sup>[488]</sup></a> our information is
exceedingly imperfect; for although it be frequently
stated how much a certain measure cost, the quality
of the wine not being mentioned at the same
time, we are very little nearer any real knowledge
of the value. In Lusitania, ten gallons of pure wine
were at one period sold for three-pence; at Athens
the price of the metretes,<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c014'><sup>[489]</sup></a> appears to have varied
from about one and eight-pence, to three and four-pence,
though occasionally it rose as high as about
ten shillings. Even of the Mendæan, a wine of
very superior quality, the wholesale price did not,
at one period, exceed two drachmas, the metretes;
but as the innkeepers were accused of having made
enormous profits, it is at the same time quite credible,
that they should occasionally have charged an
obolos for the hemicotyla, especially to tipling women.
Elsewhere, however, we find the chous, or
twelve cotylæ, sold for an obolos,<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c014'><sup>[490]</sup></a> the price, doubtless,
depending partly on the quality of the wine,
partly on the conscience of the innkeeper. For, notwithstanding
that there were at Athens three magistrates
charged with the inspection of wines,<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c014'><sup>[491]</sup></a> part
of whose business it probably was to prevent adulteration
and exorbitant prices, the vintners, male
and female, in all likelihood were an overmatch for
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most of the means by which the ancients adulterated
their wines appear to be unknown to us,
though we find that they endeavoured to restore the
taste of such as were spoiled, by mingling with them
a certain quantity of boiled wine<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c014'><sup>[492]</sup></a> and preparations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of lime and gypsum. To check the progress of the
second fermentation, they were sometimes in the
habit of casting a pumice-stone into the jar;<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c014'><sup>[493]</sup></a> but
where wine was so cheap, there was little temptation
to have recourse to any other art than that
of watering a little, which, according to the comic
poet, might proceed from a benevolent desire to keep
men sober and preserve their health.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c014'><sup>[494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The stock of a respectable wine-merchant must
have been peculiarly rich and varied,<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c014'><sup>[495]</sup></a> consisting of
the Anthosmias, a wine of delicious fragrance; the
Lesbian,<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c014'><sup>[496]</sup></a> a favourite wine of Alcibiades;<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c014'><sup>[497]</sup></a> the Pramnian,<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c014'><sup>[498]</sup></a>
a strong rough wine, celebrated by Homer;<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c014'><sup>[499]</sup></a>
the Lemnian, quaffed by the heroes before Troy;<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c014'><sup>[500]</sup></a>
the Chian, light and delicate;<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c014'><sup>[501]</sup></a> the Kapnian, from
Beneventum in Italy,<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c014'><sup>[502]</sup></a> a sharp red wine which made
the eyes water like smoke;<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c014'><sup>[503]</sup></a> the Mesogeites, from
Mount Tmolos,<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c014'><sup>[504]</sup></a> which, however delicious might
be its taste, gave those who drank it the head-ache;
the Phygelites, from Ephesos, equal to that
of Lesbos; those of Cos and Clazomenè, pleasant

mixed with sea-water; the Cydonian;<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c014'><sup>[505]</sup></a> the Maronæan,<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c014'><sup>[506]</sup></a>

the Port; and the Thasian, which may be
regarded as the flower of the whole for excellence
and celebrity.<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c014'><sup>[509]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There were several wines among the ancients
which acquired peculiar qualities and flavour from
the way in which they were made or preserved.
Thus, in Galatia,<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c014'><sup>[510]</sup></a> where, as the grapes ripened
but imperfectly, the wine had a tendency to grow
sour, a hemicotyla of resin was poured into the
metretes of wine, which gave it at first a harsh
taste, though in time it acquired a better flavour.
In this process the resin was pounded in a mortar,
with a quantity of the pine-bark. Some persons
allowed it to remain in the vessel, while others
strained it off immediately after fermentation. The
wine which was preserved by an infusion of pitch,<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c014'><sup>[511]</sup></a>
was manufactured in the following manner: the
pitch was washed with brine and sea-water<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c014'><sup>[512]</sup></a> until it
whitened, then cleansed perfectly with fresh-water,
after which an ounce or two was mingled with
eight choes of wine. The saline wines were made<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c014'><sup>[513]</sup></a>
either by dipping the bunches as gathered into sea-water,
or sprinkling them therewith, or pouring it
along with them into the press after they had been
dried in the sun. But in whatever manner prepared,
wines of this description were regarded with an evil
eye by physicians.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the other riches of an Hellenic cellar were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>mead or metheglin,<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c014'><sup>[514]</sup></a> and hydromel<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c014'><sup>[515]</sup></a> and omphacomel,<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c014'><sup>[516]</sup></a>
with perry and cider,<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c014'><sup>[517]</sup></a> and palm-wine<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c014'><sup>[518]</sup></a> and fig-wine<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c014'><sup>[519]</sup></a>
and quince-wine<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c014'><sup>[520]</sup></a> and lotos<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c014'><sup>[521]</sup></a> and pomegranate-wine.<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c014'><sup>[522]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Numerous odoriferous plants were likewise employed
in communicating a variety of flavours and
fragrance to wine, as the rose,<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c014'><sup>[523]</sup></a> thyme,<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c014'><sup>[524]</sup></a> germander,<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c014'><sup>[525]</sup></a>

squills,<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c014'><sup>[531]</sup></a> myrtle,<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c014'><sup>[532]</sup></a> mastic,<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c014'><sup>[533]</sup></a> terebinth,<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c014'><sup>[534]</sup></a> sycamore,<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c014'><sup>[535]</sup></a>
fir-cones,<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c014'><sup>[536]</sup></a> cedar-cones,<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c014'><sup>[537]</sup></a> cypress-cones,<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c014'><sup>[538]</sup></a> juniper-berries,<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c014'><sup>[539]</sup></a>
pitch, and larchtree-cones.<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c014'><sup>[540]</sup></a> Almost every
other aromatic plant, shrub, and tree, was in like manner,
employed to communicate a flavour, or an odour,
to wine, chiefly, however, for medicinal purposes; and
among these was the hyssop, whose leaves were used in
the following manner: a pound of them, having been
well bruised, were tied up in a sort of gauze, and
by the weight of a few intermingled pebbles sunk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>to the bottom of the amphora. Here they were
permitted to remain forty days, after which the wine
was racked.<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c014'><sup>[541]</sup></a> Of these wines that which was tinctured
with rose-leaves was commonly drunk after
dinner to promote digestion.<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c014'><sup>[542]</sup></a> That which, about
the Propontis and Thrace, was flavoured with wormwood,
people destined for their summer drink, considering
it favourable to health.<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c014'><sup>[543]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The greatest enemies of the vintners<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c014'><sup>[544]</sup></a> were the
physicians who, by dwelling on the pernicious qualities
of wine, deterred the reasonable part of the
world from a too frequent use of it. Old wine, they
maintained, shatters the nerves and produces headache;
new wine is the parent of horrible dreams.
That which is middling, however, for example, about
seven years old, is liable to fewer objections, and
may upon the whole be drunk with some degree of
safety. White wine, too, according to their opinion,
is better than red, since it corroborates the stomach,
and is, probably, that kind which, when of a proper
age, produces pleasant dreams.<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c014'><sup>[545]</sup></a> Pure wine, in general,
moreover, was admitted to improve the health
and beautify the complexion; and Pindar, whom most
persons will allow to have been a good judge, though
he could not, like Anacreon, dispose of a cask at
a sitting,<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c014'><sup>[546]</sup></a> declares in favour of old wine and new
songs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of beer, though, as we have elsewhere remarked,
it was familiarly known to the Egyptians,<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c014'><sup>[547]</sup></a> as well
as to the inhabitants of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, who
manufactured it from barley and service-berries, as
the people of Dantzic now do from the hips of the
wild roses,<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c014'><sup>[548]</sup></a> we need say nothing, as the Greeks were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>so ignorant of its nature, that when the Ten Thousand
met with a quantity in Armenia they diluted
it with water as they were accustomed to do their
wine, that is to say, entirely spoiled it.<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c014'><sup>[549]</sup></a> The establishments
of these vintners were almost of necessity
most frequent in the neighbourhood of the agora,<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c014'><sup>[550]</sup></a>
where the rustics from the country congregated in
crowds on market-days; where were held also, on
many occasions, the public assemblies; and where
newsmongers and loungers of every description most
generally passed their leisure hours.</p>

<p class='c001'>Making due allowance for difference of dimensions,
and their greater or less magnificence, the
same description will apply to the agoræ of all Grecian
cities. But, as we are best acquainted with the
features of that of Athens, if we can succeed in
delineating a tolerably correct picture of it, some
idea may, therefrom, be easily formed of all the
others. We must imagine, therefore, a large circular
open space,<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c014'><sup>[551]</sup></a> about the centre of the city, surrounded
on all sides by ranges of shops, temples,
porticoes, and other public buildings.<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c014'><sup>[552]</sup></a> It was traversed
in various directions by avenues of plane-trees,
planted shortly after the Persian war, which
in summer constituted so many shady walks. About
the middle stood the altars of Pity and the Twelve
Gods, in a circle,<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c014'><sup>[553]</sup></a> and near them were the statues
of Harmodios and Aristogeiton,<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c014'><sup>[554]</sup></a> the tyrannicides,
whose memory was cherished by the republic with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the most religious veneration. By far the greater
part of the space, however, was covered by rows of
sheds, booths, and tents, furnished with seats<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c014'><sup>[555]</sup></a> (the
construction of which formed a separate branch of
industry),<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c014'><sup>[556]</sup></a> where every article of use or luxury known
to the ancient world was exhibited with the utmost
attention to display. Here were the embroidered
veils, and shawls, and mantles, and sandals, of the
mercer’s quarter;<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c014'><sup>[557]</sup></a> there the chains of gold, the armlets,
the anklets, the jewelled circlets for the head,
the golden grasshoppers, the seals, the rings, the
agraffes, the brooches, the cameos, and every description
of engraved gems which constituted the
attractions of the jewellers’ quarter. Here were
waggons piled with jars, and skins filled with wine;
there huge pyramids of apples and pears, and quinces
and pomegranates, and dates and plums, and cherries
and mulberries, black and white, and grape-clusters
of every hue, and oranges and citrons, and
rich purple figs, and melons and water-melons.<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c014'><sup>[558]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Touching upon these booths were the stalls of
the green-grocers, of Eucharides<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c014'><sup>[559]</sup></a> for example, where
every vegetable produced in the kitchen-garden and
the fields met the eye in profusion; among which
were truffles of all kinds,<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c014'><sup>[560]</sup></a> with the roots of the
caraway<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c014'><sup>[561]</sup></a> and jagged lettuce, which were eaten
like those of the Egyptian bean<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c014'><sup>[562]</sup></a> and the papyrus,<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c014'><sup>[563]</sup></a>
radishes,<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c014'><sup>[564]</sup></a> long and round, bunches of turnips,<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c014'><sup>[565]</sup></a> asparagus,
broccoli,<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c014'><sup>[566]</sup></a> heads of garlic, and summer savory,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>for the poor, all kinds of beans and pease, the vervain<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c014'><sup>[567]</sup></a>
for purification and amulets, wild myrtle sprigs
instead of asparagus,<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c014'><sup>[568]</sup></a> shoots of the black briony,<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c014'><sup>[569]</sup></a>
chokeweed to be boiled with vegetables for rendering
them tender, tufts of the wild fig-tree, which
performed the same service for beef,<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c014'><sup>[570]</sup></a> goats-beard,
clematis for seasoning,<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c014'><sup>[571]</sup></a> with bunches of elm-leaves
commonly used as a vegetable.<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c014'><sup>[572]</sup></a> Next to these,
were, perhaps, the stands of the flower-sellers,<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c014'><sup>[573]</sup></a> where
garlands of the richest colours and fragrance were
ready wreathed for the brow,<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c014'><sup>[574]</sup></a> some produced by
careful culture in gardens, and others gathered where
they grew wild by the women, who in time of peace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>spread themselves in troops over the whole country
for this purpose.<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c014'><sup>[575]</sup></a> In one corner were droves of
horses, asses, and mules,<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c014'><sup>[576]</sup></a> ready to have their teeth
inspected by the buyers,<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c014'><sup>[577]</sup></a> or groups of youthful slaves
from all quarters of the world. In another, near a
lofty poplar,<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c014'><sup>[578]</sup></a> stood the auction-mart where goods
of every description,<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c014'><sup>[579]</sup></a> including even libraries,<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c014'><sup>[580]</sup></a> were
knocked down by the hammer. Close at hand, perhaps,
stood the tempting booths of the chapmen
who purveyed for the kitchen of the Athenians
with hams, and sausages, and black-puddings,<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c014'><sup>[581]</sup></a> and
pickles, and cheese, and preserved fruits, and spices,
from the farthest east. Here were the sellers<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c014'><sup>[582]</sup></a> of
salt-meat and fish from the Black Sea,<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c014'><sup>[583]</sup></a> there the
toy-shops and upholsterers, while ever and anon the
crowds that thronged the passages were compelled
to make way for a string of asses<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c014'><sup>[584]</sup></a> laden with vegetables
or wood from Parnes or Cithæron, with the
ends sticking out on both sides and threatening
the eyes of the buyers. Sometimes a porter,<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c014'><sup>[585]</sup></a> with
a wooden knot on his shoulders, bore along, like
Protagoras, a load of faggots, the size of which astonished
the beholders. At times, near the corner of
the street leading from the Eleusinian Gate, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>saw a half-starved Megarean<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c014'><sup>[586]</sup></a> sneaking through the
crowd and bringing along with him sucking pigs,
and leverets, and cucumbers, and salt-fish, and garlic,<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c014'><sup>[587]</sup></a>
which if observed by the agoranomoi were, during wartime,
seized as contraband. On the other hand the
broad-faced jolly B&oelig;otian<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c014'><sup>[588]</sup></a> came smirking and grinning,
like a Neapolitan, with mule-loads of wild
marjoram, pennyroyal, eaten by sheep, mats, lampwicks,
fowls,<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c014'><sup>[589]</sup></a> ducks, locusts, jackdaws, francolins,<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c014'><sup>[590]</sup></a>
coots, divers, geese, hares, foxes, moles, hedgehogs,
cats, pyctides, otters, and eels, from Lake Copaïs.
Here in rows stood, black as chimney-sweeps, the
charcoal-sellers from Acharnæ, with their mallequins
and rush-baskets full piled before them.<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c014'><sup>[591]</sup></a> Yonder
were the cornchandlers,<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c014'><sup>[592]</sup></a> surrounded by piles of sacks,
measuring their grain, while a horde of ragged spermologoi<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c014'><sup>[593]</sup></a>
hovered round to collect what fell. Close
at hand stood the flour-merchants, each beside his
huge covered wooden trough,<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c014'><sup>[594]</sup></a> from which he measured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>forth flour or barley-meal to the buyers. Beyond
these were the stalls of the fishmongers,<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c014'><sup>[595]</sup></a> the
flambeau-sellers<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c014'><sup>[596]</sup></a> and the shining jars of the oil-merchants,
piled in heaps to the roof of the booths.
In other rows were the shops of the potters,<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c014'><sup>[597]</sup></a> where
every variety of jugs, vases, and tureens, was exhibited
with vessels of glass, and bronze, and ivory.
Here and there, threading their way through the
multitude, you beheld the pedlar<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c014'><sup>[598]</sup></a> with his pack of
small-wares, the hawker crying his fish or fruit,<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c014'><sup>[599]</sup></a> or
vegetables, or sausages, or wild-fowl, laid out on a
board on his head; the female bread-seller, with a
variety of delicate loaves and cakes piled up before
her on a tray; the pastry-girl with sweetmeats; the
flower-girl with nosegays of fresh violets from the
meadows of Colonos and the banks of the Eridanos
and Cephissos. Sheltered from the warm rays of
the sun, beneath some magnificent marble colonnade,
or the portico of some temple or chapel, sat whole
bevies of female flute-players, citharists, or dancing-girls,<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c014'><sup>[600]</sup></a>
calling forth, from time to time, whilst waiting
to be hired for a party, bursts of music from
their instruments, or humming a war-song, or a Palladian
hymn, or a merry scholion, the favourite ditties
of the Athenian people. Near these, as being folks
of the same kidney, the jugglers, cooks, and parasites,<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c014'><sup>[601]</sup></a>
took up their position; the former two ready
to be hired for the day by the giver of some magnificent
entertainment, the latter that they might
discover in what direction they were to ply their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>craft and ferret out a dinner scotfree. Near the
Eurysaceum in this neighbourhood stood that eminence
called the Hill of the Agora,<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c014'><sup>[602]</sup></a> or Misthios,
because servants, in lack of a master, collected there
to be hired, as they still do at fairs in most parts
of England. Somewhere close at hand were the
shops of those brokers who let out pots and pans,
and lamps and plate, and the more delicate kind
of crockery, to such persons as were too economical
to keep such articles of their own.<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c014'><sup>[603]</sup></a> In the midst
of this profusion of wares might be seen, at all
hours of the day, crowds of well-dressed persons<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c014'><sup>[604]</sup></a>
sauntering to and fro, chatting with each other,
cheapening the goods of the shopkeepers, or laughing
and jesting with the flower-girls or fluteplayers.
At other times individuals, by no means deserving
the name of loiterers, came thither, either to post
up a bill<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c014'><sup>[605]</sup></a> of some article which they had found,
or in quest of some information respecting one they
had lost, either from such bills or from the public
criers who were there accustomed to make proclamation
of treasure trove, or to cry that such or
such an article of property had strayed from its
lawful owner. Occasionally also people made known
by criers what goods they had for sale.<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c014'><sup>[606]</sup></a> The young
men of rank, when fatigued by these promenades,
used to retire into a perfumer’s or barber’s or armourer’s
or bridle-maker’s shop,<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c014'><sup>[607]</sup></a> overlooking the
bustling scene, where they discussed nonsense or
politics, according to their humour. Hither, too,
the philosophers came with a view to inspire patriotic
and manly sentiments into the minds of these
future rulers of the democracy; so that at one period
you might have beheld Socrates and Alcibiades and
Critias, and Chæriphon and Crito, with Charmides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>and the divine Plato, engaged in those animated
dialogues, the echo of which still rings sweetly in
the ears of posterity. In some shops opposite these,
as if with a view to rival or eclipse them, or round
one of the umbrellas,<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c014'><sup>[608]</sup></a> beneath which, on an elevated
platform, the perfumers dispensed their wares in the
agora, stood a group of sophists with their followers,
such as Hippias of Elis, Prodicos of Cos, or the
Agrigentine Polos, or Gorgias of Leontium, habited
in purple robes, embroidered vests, flowered sandals,
and with glittering crowns of gold upon their heads.
Even their florid discourses, however, would fail to
command the attention of their auditors when the
youth of equestrian rank,<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c014'><sup>[609]</sup></a> mounted on their chargers
and drawn up in military array, swept round
the outer circle of the agora, paying devout homage
to each divinity whose fane they passed. Here
also in a future age might be seen, strutting to and
fro, the orator Æschines with his arms akimbo and
a fashionable little hat<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c014'><sup>[610]</sup></a> stuck knowingly on one
side of his head, railing at Demosthenes, and pleading
the cause of Philip. And here, too, the night
after the fall of Elatea, a very different scene was
witnessed when the citizens from every side of the
Cecropian rock rushed tumultuously hither in the
wildest alarm, and either not reflecting on what
they did, or through ill-judged haste, set fire to the
sheds and booths in order that they might find a
clear space to deliberate on the public safety.</p>

<p class='c001'>As there was a certain class of gods who presided
over the market-place, so likewise were there particular
laws enacted to regulate its transactions, with
magistrates especially appointed to carry those laws
into execution. These servants of the commonwealth,
five in the city and five in the Peiræeus, were denominated
Agoranomoi, and paraded all day to and fro,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>armed with whips of many thongs,<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c014'><sup>[611]</sup></a> amid the crowds
of buyers and sellers, both to preserve tranquillity
in the market, and prevent or punish those petty
acts of fraud and injustice to which persons who subsist
by humble traffic are too often in all countries
addicted. Thus we find that, not the vintners only,
but even the cornchandlers kept small measures;<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c014'><sup>[612]</sup></a>
though, as there was a public meter appointed by
the state, it could only be when purchasers neglected
to employ him, that they lay open to this sort of
imposition. Chapmen detected in cheating, or otherwise
behaving with impropriety, were scourged by the
Agoranomoi on the spot; and it is to be presumed,
that, as often as necessary, these officers were attended
by a detachment of that powerful and vigilant
Scythian police, at one period a thousand
strong, which Athens constantly maintained, and
which formerly pitched its tents in the agora.<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c014'><sup>[613]</sup></a> Another
duty of the Agoranomoi<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c014'><sup>[614]</sup></a> was to collect the
tolls paid by B&oelig;otians, Æginetæ, or Megareans,
upon whatever articles they brought to the Athenian
market. It should here be observed, however,
that neither corn nor bread was in later times, at
least, placed under the inspection of these magistrates,
since there were others called Sitophylaces,<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c014'><sup>[615]</sup></a>
whose business it was to see that the public were
not defrauded in such articles. The number of these
officers, at first three, was afterwards increased to
fifteen, of which ten presided over the city corn-market,
and five over that of the harbour, where
a portico was built by Pericles<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c014'><sup>[616]</sup></a> for the special use
of the cornchandlers and flour-merchants.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>On the prices of articles,<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c014'><sup>[617]</sup></a> our information is extremely
incomplete: it is said, however, that an ox in
Solon’s time, was sold for five drachmas,<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c014'><sup>[618]</sup></a> a sheep for
one; while about the same period, the former animal
sold at Rome for a hundred oboloi, and the latter for
ten. In the later, and what are called the more flourishing,
ages of the commonwealth, a sheep, according
to its age, size, and breed, fetched from ten to twenty
drachmas, an ox from fifty to a hundred. The
price of a fine saddle-horse, in the age of Pericles,
was twelve minæ, or about fifty pounds sterling,<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c014'><sup>[619]</sup></a> but
a common animal for draught might be obtained for
three minæ. The price of thirteen talents paid by
Alexander for Bucephalos was a mere arbitrary piece
of extravagance. A yoke of mules sold from five
to eight minas; asses sometimes for thirty drachmas;<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c014'><sup>[620]</sup></a>
a sucking-pig for three drachmas;<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c014'><sup>[621]</sup></a> a dove or
a crow fetched three oboloi; a jackdaw or a partridge
one obolos, though the philosopher Aristippos chose
to give fifty drachmas for a single bird of this kind;
seven chaffinches for an obolos. A ch&oelig;nix of olives
cost two chalci, and a cotyla of the best Attic honey
five drachmas.</p>

<p class='c001'>The weights and measures<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c014'><sup>[622]</sup></a> in common use at

a hundred drachmas; the drachma (6 dwt. 2 grs.)

<p class='c001'><a href='#r393'>393</a>. In Plutarch’s life of Pericles
there occurs a very remarkable
passage, describing the constant
employment and plenty which
were diffused through the city by
the policy of that great statesman.
As for the mechanics and
meaner sort of people, they went
not without their share of the
public money, nor yet received
it to maintain them in idleness.
By the constructing of great edifices,
which require many arts,
and a long time to finish them,
they had equal pretensions to be
recompensed out of the treasury,
(though they stirred not from the
city,) with the mariners, soldiers,
and garrisons. For the different
materials, such as stone, brass,
ivory, gold, ebony, and cypress,
furnished employment to carpenters,
masons, braziers, goldsmiths,
painters, turners, and other artificers;
the conveyance of them
by sea employed merchants and
sailors, and, by land, wheelwrights,
waggoners, carriers,
rope-makers, leather-cutters, paviers,
and iron-founders; and
every art had a number of the
lower people ranged in proper
subordination to execute it, like
soldiers under the command of
a general. Thus, by the exercise
of these different trades, was
plenty diffused among persons of
every rank and condition. § 12.

ancients who attributed the invention
of mills to the Pelasgian
Myles, son of Lelex, probably
that they might have a hero from
whose name they could conveniently
derive the word μυλῶν.—Ἀπ’
αὐτου (τοῦ ἱερου Ποσειδῶνος)
προελθόντι ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ Ταΰγετον
ὀνομάζουσιν Ἀλεσίας χωρίον,
Μύλητα τὸν Λέλεγος πρῶτον

to Hesychius, (v. Μυλὰς)
this hero Myles or Mylas was
one of the Telchines: Μυλὰς,
εἷς τῶν Τελχίνων, ὃς τὰ ἐν
Καμείρῳ ἱερα Μυλαντείων ἱδρύσατο.
The tradition attributing to this
personage the invention of mills
is thus related by Stephanus:

  <h3 id='ch6.3' class='c012'>CHAPTER III.<br /> INDUSTRY: PERFUMERS, BARBERS, GOLDSMITHS, LAPIDARIES, ETC.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It has been already observed that the shops of
the perfumers<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c014'><sup>[632]</sup></a> were, for the most part, situated in
the Agora or its neighbourhood, and much frequented
by newsmongers and young men of distinction. From
this it follows, that they must have been of spacious
dimensions; and it is extremely probable that they
were fitted up with every attention to show and
elegance. They necessarily contained a number of
seats and chairs for the accommodation of customers,
and there can scarcely be a doubt, that the
various unguents, perfumes, oils, and essences, were
ranged on shelves, along the walls, in fine jars, vases
of Cyprian marble, and boxes of alabaster,<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c014'><sup>[633]</sup></a> sometimes
of one piece, with vessels of glass and silver,<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c014'><sup>[634]</sup></a>
or fine earthenware, or porcelain, or beautiful sea-shells.<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c014'><sup>[635]</sup></a>
The counters were probably of marble or
polished stone, as at Pompeii; and the shopman
was supplied with the usual paraphernalia of scales
and weights,<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c014'><sup>[636]</sup></a> and measures, and ladles, and spoons,
and spatulæ, as in modern times. Peron, an Egyptian,
the owner of one of these shops, has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>thought of sufficient consequence to have his name
transmitted to posterity.<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c014'><sup>[637]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From the richness and variety of odours made
use of by the ancients we may infer, that the fragrance
of such an establishment at Athens, exceeded
that of Araby the Blest. For every land
and every sweet flower that grew supplied some
ingredient to the endless stock of the perfumer.<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c014'><sup>[638]</sup></a>
There was incense, and frankincense, and spikenard,<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c014'><sup>[639]</sup></a>
and myrrh, and oils of saffron and cinnamon,<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c014'><sup>[640]</sup></a> and
sweet marjoram,<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c014'><sup>[641]</sup></a> and fenugreek,<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c014'><sup>[642]</sup></a> and roses,<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c014'><sup>[643]</sup></a> and
hyoscyamos,<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c014'><sup>[644]</sup></a> and maiden’s hair,<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c014'><sup>[645]</sup></a> and iris,<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c014'><sup>[646]</sup></a> and lilies,<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c014'><sup>[647]</sup></a>
and watermint, and rosemary, and eastern privet,<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c014'><sup>[648]</sup></a>
and baccharis,<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c014'><sup>[649]</sup></a> and thyme. In truth the Athenians,
who were esteemed the inventors of all good and
useful things,<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c014'><sup>[650]</sup></a> delighted exceedingly in the luxury
of sweet smells, and therefore culled from Sicily,
and Egypt, and Ph&oelig;nicia, and Lydia, and Babylonia,
and India, and Arabia, whatever could communicate
a pleasing scent to their garments,<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c014'><sup>[651]</sup></a> their apartments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>or their beards. Even the doves and swallows that
flew tame about the house had their feathers drenched
with odoriferous essences, which they scattered with
their waving wings through the air.<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c014'><sup>[652]</sup></a> This excessive
passion for perfumes rendered the favourite articles
of it dear, so that of some kinds a cotyla sold for two
or five minæ;<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c014'><sup>[653]</sup></a> of others, for ten; while the balm
of Gilead, even in the country where it was collected,
was valued at double its weight in silver.<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c014'><sup>[654]</sup></a> There
were, however, inferior kinds of perfume, some of
which were cheap enough, since we find that an
alabaster boxful, brought from the East, sometimes
sold for two drachmas.<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c014'><sup>[655]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Great use was made of saffron as a perfume.<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c014'><sup>[656]</sup></a> Halls,
courts, and theatres were saturated with its odour,<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c014'><sup>[657]</sup></a>
and statues<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c014'><sup>[658]</sup></a> were made to flow, like common fountains,
with saffron-water. From a great number of
other flowers, essences and unguents were likewise prepared;
such as our lady’s rose, southernwood,<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c014'><sup>[659]</sup></a> vine-flowers,<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c014'><sup>[660]</sup></a>
the narcissus,<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c014'><sup>[661]</sup></a> anis-flower,<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c014'><sup>[662]</sup></a> high taper, betel-leaf,
and the jasmine, which, in Persia, was used at
banquets and in the baths.<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c014'><sup>[663]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the preparation of unguents, numerous articles
were made use of, either to give them consistency
or to modify the scent: among these were the root
of the anchusa,<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c014'><sup>[664]</sup></a> palm spatha,<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c014'><sup>[665]</sup></a> butter,<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c014'><sup>[666]</sup></a> sweet-scented
moss,<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c014'><sup>[667]</sup></a> and the odoriferous reed.<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c014'><sup>[668]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Several unguents received their names from the
persons who invented them, or from the places whence
they were imported, though others were distinguished
by appellations which are no longer intelligible:
thus, the Megalion or Megalesian derived
its name from Megallos, a Sicilian perfumer;<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c014'><sup>[669]</sup></a> the
Plangonian from Plango, a female perfumer of Elis.<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c014'><sup>[670]</sup></a>
The black ointment, doubtless, received its name
from its colour; but wherefore the Sagdas is so
called is not known:<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c014'><sup>[671]</sup></a> both these were of Egyptian
manufacture. From Lydia was imported the Brenthion,<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c014'><sup>[672]</sup></a>
and from Babylonia the Nardon, which disputed
the prize with the royal unguent. There was
among the Egyptians a perfume called Cyphi,<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c014'><sup>[673]</sup></a> entirely
appropriated to the use of the gods, into the
composition of which entered the following ingredients;
the cyperus, a quantity of juniper-berries,
raisins, odoriferous reeds and rushes, the aspalathos,
myrrh, wine, resin, and honey, mixed in certain proportions,
and reduced to a fine paste. Unguent of
roses was preserved by an admixture of salt.<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c014'><sup>[674]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the perfumers dealt not in odours and essences
only, their stock containing every variety of cosmetic
for the use of the ladies, who made a complete
business of beautifying their faces,<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c014'><sup>[675]</sup></a> which at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>length became wholly artificial, rather a mask than
a countenance.<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c014'><sup>[676]</sup></a> They whitened their foreheads, dyed
their eyebrows, and fashioned them like arches, painted
black the edges of their eyelids,<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c014'><sup>[677]</sup></a> rendered their eyes
humid and bright by powder-of-lead ore, spread over
their faces the hues of the lily intermingled with the
bloom of the rose, adorned themselves with false ringlets,
changed the yellow into black, the black into
auburn,<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c014'><sup>[678]</sup></a> gave a ruby tinge to their lips, and blanched
their teeth into ivory. But the psimmythion,<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c014'><sup>[679]</sup></a> (ceruse
or white lead,) which rendered them fair, undermined
their constitution, and poisoned their breath.
On the subject of rouge, the Greeks had a very
poetical and beautiful saying:—“She plants roses
in her cheeks,” said they, “which, like those of
Locris, will bloom in an hour and fade in less.”<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c014'><sup>[680]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One sort of rouge<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c014'><sup>[681]</sup></a> appears to have been obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>from a species of sea-moss or wrake,<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c014'><sup>[682]</sup></a> which some have
confounded with the anchusa,<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c014'><sup>[683]</sup></a> though the grammarians
enumerate them as things entirely different. One
of the commentators supposes the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>purpurissa</i></span> to be
meant, by which the Romans understood a sort of cheek-varnish,
vermilion, or Spanish paint. There was in
use a pigment for the eyebrows, called Hypogramma,<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c014'><sup>[684]</sup></a>
and the edges of the eyelids were tinged black with
Stimmis,<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c014'><sup>[685]</sup></a> an oxyde of antimony, which still constitutes
one of the articles of the female toilette in the
East. Sometimes the eyebrows were blackened with
resin soot,<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c014'><sup>[686]</sup></a> and the eyelashes caused to lie regularly
by naphtha,<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c014'><sup>[687]</sup></a> and a sort of paste composed of glue
and pounded marble.<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c014'><sup>[688]</sup></a> Another curious cosmetic was,
the Adarces,<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c014'><sup>[689]</sup></a> a substance resembling congealed froth,
found on reeds and the dry stalks of plants about
the ponds and marshes of Cappadocia. It was said to
remove freckles, and enjoyed, likewise, great credit in
medicine. A preparation composed of the flour of turnip-seed,
lupines, wheat, darnel, and chick-peas, was
used for clearing the skin; so, likewise, were the Chian
and Selinusian earths,<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c014'><sup>[690]</sup></a> which removed wrinkles, and
rendered the skin smooth and shining. They were in
constant use in the baths. Cassia,<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c014'><sup>[691]</sup></a> honey,<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c014'><sup>[692]</sup></a> pepper,<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c014'><sup>[693]</sup></a>
and myrrh,<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c014'><sup>[694]</sup></a> cured pimples and effaced spots; fenugreek<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c014'><sup>[695]</sup></a>
whitened the hands and removed sunburns;
briony,<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c014'><sup>[696]</sup></a> isinglass,<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c014'><sup>[697]</sup></a> costos,<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c014'><sup>[698]</sup></a> galbanum,<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c014'><sup>[699]</sup></a> lupines, rainwater,<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c014'><sup>[700]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>radishes,<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c014'><sup>[701]</sup></a> and hare’s blood,<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c014'><sup>[702]</sup></a> the biscutella
didyma,<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c014'><sup>[703]</sup></a> truffles,<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c014'><sup>[704]</sup></a> cinnamon,<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c014'><sup>[705]</sup></a> linseed,<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c014'><sup>[706]</sup></a> ladanum,<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c014'><sup>[707]</sup></a> iris-roots,<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c014'><sup>[708]</sup></a>
white hellebore,<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c014'><sup>[709]</sup></a> Sardinian honey,<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c014'><sup>[710]</sup></a> onion-juice,<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c014'><sup>[711]</sup></a>
and spring-wheat, moistened with oxymel,<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c014'><sup>[712]</sup></a>
were among the principal preparations for removing
moles and freckles, and beautifying the skin. In
some parts of Greece elm-juice,<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c014'><sup>[713]</sup></a> expressed at the
first putting forth of the leaves in spring, was employed
to give clearness and resplendency to the
complexion. Almond-paste,<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c014'><sup>[714]</sup></a> also, with the roots of
the bitter almond-tree, effaced spots from the skin.
Others, for the same purpose, made use of the berries
of the wild-vine,<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c014'><sup>[715]</sup></a> and a paste was prepared from
lilies which induced fairness, and rendered the face
smooth and shining.<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c014'><sup>[716]</sup></a> To protect the complexion
from the sun, the whole countenance was varnished,
as it were, with white of egg;<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c014'><sup>[717]</sup></a> and some women,
possibly rustics, used goose and hen’s grease as a
cosmetic.<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c014'><sup>[718]</sup></a> The roots of the spikenard, when imported
from the East, usually retained about them
a little of the soil in which the plant had grown:<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c014'><sup>[719]</sup></a>
this was carefully rubbed off, and having been
passed through a fine sieve, was used for washing
the hands, as it probably retained something of the
fragrance of the plant. Rose leaves, reduced to
powder, were sprinkled over persons as they issued
from the bath, particularly about the eyes, to heighten
the freshness of the face.<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c014'><sup>[720]</sup></a> To communicate additional
sweetness to their persons, Greek ladies sometimes
wore about their necks carcanets of rose pastilles<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c014'><sup>[721]</sup></a>
instead of jewelled necklaces, into the composition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of which, however, several other ingredients
entered, as nard, myrrh, costos, Illyrian iris, honey,
and Chian wine.</p>

<p class='c001'>The dentifrices<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c014'><sup>[722]</sup></a> of the Greeks consisted chiefly
of the purple fish, burnt with salt, and reduced to
powder;<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c014'><sup>[723]</sup></a> the Arabic stone,<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c014'><sup>[724]</sup></a> calcined in like manner;
and pumice-stone.<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c014'><sup>[725]</sup></a> Asses’ milk was used as a gargle
to preserve the teeth.<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c014'><sup>[726]</sup></a> The toothpicks<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c014'><sup>[727]</sup></a> most
commonly used were small slips of cane, or green
branches of the lentiscus,<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c014'><sup>[728]</sup></a> the ashes of which were
likewise mingled with all kinds of tooth-powder.
The citron,<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c014'><sup>[729]</sup></a> eaten as a remedy for longing, was
thought to render the breath sweet. There was a
kind of ointment prepared of saffron, which, mingled
with water, they employed to restore brilliance
to eyes which had lost their colour.<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c014'><sup>[730]</sup></a> A pomatum,
composed of oil and the husks of filbert-nuts burnt
and reduced to powder, was used in infancy to change
blue eyes into black.<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c014'><sup>[731]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The barbers, who, both in locality and repute,
were next-door neighbours to the perfumers, enjoyed
much the same sort of reputation as they do in modern
times. In their shops scandal was fabricated, and
news, good and bad, put into circulation. It was
at a barber’s in the Peiræeus that some stranger
first disclosed the intelligence of the defeat in Sicily,
thereby bringing the longue-tongued shaver into the
greatest trouble; for as he straightway ran up to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>city and gave vent to the evil tidings, he was apprehended
and put to the torture, in order to discover
the real author of what was supposed to be an atrocious
fabrication.<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c014'><sup>[732]</sup></a> But that which sometimes thus
brought them into straits, proved most commonly
a source of profit, since to hear their laughable stories
and anecdotes many more persons congregated under
their roofs than stood in need of new wigs or curling-irons,<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c014'><sup>[733]</sup></a>
and probably got shaved by way of compliment to
the master of the house. Such of them as were remarkably
unskilful sought to make up for their awkwardness<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c014'><sup>[734]</sup></a>
by the number and elegance of their razors, and
the large size of their mirrors.<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c014'><sup>[735]</sup></a> But it was not, we
are told, unfrequent for men to get shaved by some
humble practitioner,<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c014'><sup>[736]</sup></a> with one razor and a cunning
hand, and afterwards to lounge into the more dashing
shops, to put their curls in order before the large
mirrors which adorned the walls.<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c014'><sup>[737]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If we may judge by the works of art that have
come down to us, however, the barbers of Hellas
generally understood their business in great perfection,
since nowhere do we find more shapely heads
or finer curls than on the statues of antiquity.<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c014'><sup>[738]</sup></a>
Even here, however, we discover few traces of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>variety in the manner of cutting and dressing the
hair,<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c014'><sup>[739]</sup></a> for which they were chiefly distinguished.
While the beard<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c014'><sup>[740]</sup></a> was worn, their principal occupation
must have been the clipping, curling, and
perfuming of it; but afterwards when persons shaved
in order to appear young,<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c014'><sup>[741]</sup></a> and had learned to cover
their bald pates with wigs,<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c014'><sup>[742]</sup></a> their business grew to be
much the same as it is at present. Their arts were
necessarily in great request among the ladies, for
whom they contrived false eyebrows,<a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c014'><sup>[743]</sup></a> and innumerable
dyes for giving whatever colour they desired to the
hair, rendering it luxuriant and preventing it from
turning grey. Hog’s lard and even bear’s grease
mixed with powder of burnt filberts<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c014'><sup>[744]</sup></a> were then in
great request for strengthening and restoring the hair,
together with onion-juice,<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c014'><sup>[745]</sup></a> olives steeped in wine,<a id='r746' /><a href='#f746' class='c014'><sup>[746]</sup></a>

by passing a needle through them, and immediately

cabbage-leaf,<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c014'><sup>[751]</sup></a> a hare’s head reduced to ashes,<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c014'><sup>[752]</sup></a> the

Among the depilatory preparations<a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c014'><sup>[761]</sup></a> used
by ancient barbers may be enumerated the fumitory,<a id='r762' /><a href='#f762' class='c014'><sup>[762]</sup></a>
the scolopendra thalassia,<a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c014'><sup>[763]</sup></a> oak-fern,<a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c014'><sup>[764]</sup></a> juice of vine-leaves,<a id='r765' /><a href='#f765' class='c014'><sup>[765]</sup></a>
orpiment,<a id='r766' /><a href='#f766' class='c014'><sup>[766]</sup></a> flour of salt,<a id='r767' /><a href='#f767' class='c014'><sup>[767]</sup></a> sea-froth,<a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c014'><sup>[768]</sup></a> and the
blood of the chamelion.<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c014'><sup>[769]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To dye tresses auburn,<a id='r770' /><a href='#f770' class='c014'><sup>[770]</sup></a> a colour much admired by
the Greeks, they pounded a quantity of the leaves
of eastern privet<a id='r771' /><a href='#f771' class='c014'><sup>[771]</sup></a> in a mortar, and then steeping it
in the juice of fuller’s-herb, applied the preparation
to the hair. The same effect was produced by a decoction
of lotus stems,<a id='r772' /><a href='#f772' class='c014'><sup>[772]</sup></a> or of the herb lycion.<a id='r773' /><a href='#f773' class='c014'><sup>[773]</sup></a> As
black hair, however, obtained the preference of the
majority, partly<a id='r774' /><a href='#f774' class='c014'><sup>[774]</sup></a> perhaps because it better suited their
complexions, the number of recipes for giving it that
hue is very great. Among the most remarkable
substances employed for this purpose we may mention
the ampelitis,<a id='r775' /><a href='#f775' class='c014'><sup>[775]</sup></a> a black earth imported from
Seleucia, in Syria, and the sory,<a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c014'><sup>[776]</sup></a> a mineral found
chiefly in Egypt. To these may be added decoctions
of wood-blade,<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c014'><sup>[777]</sup></a> myrtle, and myrtle-berries,<a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c014'><sup>[778]</sup></a>
ivy,<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c014'><sup>[779]</sup></a> and dwarf-elder berries,<a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c014'><sup>[780]</sup></a> sage,<a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c014'><sup>[781]</sup></a> mulberries,<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c014'><sup>[782]</sup></a>
and palm-spathæ,<a id='r783' /><a href='#f783' class='c014'><sup>[783]</sup></a> as also cypress cones, boiled in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>vinegar.<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c014'><sup>[784]</sup></a> There prevailed an opinion in Italy<a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c014'><sup>[785]</sup></a> that
the birds which fed on the berries of the smilax or
yew-tree became black, though we do not find, that
the barbers had thought of introducing them among
the hair dyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another class of tradesmen who selected the Agora<a id='r786' /><a href='#f786' class='c014'><sup>[786]</sup></a>
or its neighbourhood, for their residence, was the
goldsmiths, silversmiths, jewellers, and lapidaries, who
were possibly of more importance in the ancient than
the modern world,<a id='r787' /><a href='#f787' class='c014'><sup>[787]</sup></a> since a much greater quantity of
the precious metals was then wrought up into plate,
whether for the temples, chapels and sanctuaries of
the gods,<a id='r788' /><a href='#f788' class='c014'><sup>[788]</sup></a> or for private individuals.<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c014'><sup>[789]</sup></a> How much
or how little of the articles they produced could be
seen at one time in their shops, it is now impossible
to determine; but if their practice resembled that of
the moderns, it would be difficult to imagine a greater
blaze of magnificence<a id='r790' /><a href='#f790' class='c014'><sup>[790]</sup></a> than must have met the eye
upon entering their establishments,—where piles of
gold and silver vessels<a id='r791' /><a href='#f791' class='c014'><sup>[791]</sup></a> of all forms and dimensions,
some burnished<a id='r792' /><a href='#f792' class='c014'><sup>[792]</sup></a> and plain, others embossed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>with every variety of figure in high or low relief,
others crusted with seed pearls,<a id='r793' /><a href='#f793' class='c014'><sup>[793]</sup></a> or brilliants, or set
with gems<a id='r794' /><a href='#f794' class='c014'><sup>[794]</sup></a> of every shade and hue, from the ruby,
the emerald, and the hyacinth, to the turquoise,
the chrysoprase, the amethyst, the beryl, and the
jasper, might be beheld rising to the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c001'>Occasionally articles of plate of enormous size
were manufactured,<a id='r795' /><a href='#f795' class='c014'><sup>[795]</sup></a> such as cisterns,<a id='r796' /><a href='#f796' class='c014'><sup>[796]</sup></a> or vases, or
tripods, or salvers, or goblets of gold or silver,
presented as offerings by whole cities or communities
to some divinity. In these cases the workmanship
was very frequently so elaborate and exquisite
as to be still more costly than the materials.
Entire landscapes, including innumerable figures and
objects were sometimes represented on the swell of
a vase or goblet: Bacchanalian processions, for example,
with whole troops of satyrs and mænades
moving along some wooded valley, or desert mountain,
or rocky shore, at the heels of the Seileni
and Dionysos, groups of nereids, nymphs, and tritons,
sporting in the warm sunshine, on the unruffled
expanse of ocean; and sacrifices, marriages, chariot-races,
and chorusses of youths and virgins, moving
through the mazes of the dance, around the altar
of Apollo or Artemis. It is also to Hellenic goldsmiths
that we are evidently to attribute those
marvellous productions of art reckoned among the
most boasted possessions of the Persian kings, such
as that vine of gold,<a id='r797' /><a href='#f797' class='c014'><sup>[797]</sup></a> with its vast grape clusters,
imitated both in size and colour by the most precious
gems, which formed a canopy over the royal
couch, or that golden platane-tree<a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c014'><sup>[798]</sup></a> and other vine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>which, rising from behind the throne, stretched its
branches, tendrils, and leaves of gold aloft over the
monarch as he sat in state to give audience to
his people. Here the bunches of grapes in various
stages of ripeness were represented by emeralds,
Indian carbuncles, and other precious stones of the
richest and most dazzling hues. These things we
know were not the works of Persians, having been
presented to Darius by Pythios, the Lydian, who,
doubtless, caused them to be fashioned by Grecian
artists. What may have been the exact dimensions
of this platane-tree we know not; but, no doubt,
Antiochos took an orator’s licence, when, in an assembly
of the Arcadians, he described it as too
diminutive to afford shelter to a grasshopper.<a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c014'><sup>[799]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We may here perhaps with propriety make mention
of that multitude of golden statues<a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c014'><sup>[800]</sup></a> which
thronged the temples of Greece. For it is not true,
as Lucian pretends, that the Hellenic gods and
goddesses were contented to shroud their beauty in
marble, bronze, or ivory, while Mithras exhibited
his rude visage, and Anubis his dog’s snout, in gold.<a id='r801' /><a href='#f801' class='c014'><sup>[801]</sup></a>
Even private individuals had statues erected to them
of this precious metal; and there were not wanting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>those who, like Gorgias, at their own expense did
the same honour to themselves.<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c014'><sup>[802]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the variety of articles thus composed of the
precious metals was so great as almost to defy description.<a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c014'><sup>[803]</sup></a>
There were candelabra,<a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c014'><sup>[804]</sup></a> thrones,<a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c014'><sup>[805]</sup></a> and
chairs, shields,<a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c014'><sup>[806]</sup></a> basins and ewers,<a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c014'><sup>[807]</sup></a> flagons, censers,
goblets in form of walnut-shells, ladles,<a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c014'><sup>[808]</sup></a> spoons,
vinegar-saucers,<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c014'><sup>[809]</sup></a> with almost every other article of
the table. Crowns, likewise, for the heads of statues
of princes, and successful generals, and other
individuals whom the public desired to honour; with
bread<a id='r810' /><a href='#f810' class='c014'><sup>[810]</sup></a> and work baskets probably in filigree, clasps,<a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c014'><sup>[811]</sup></a>
and spindles<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c014'><sup>[812]</sup></a> for ladies, with armlets, anklets, bracelets,
rings, necklaces of carbuncles,<a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c014'><sup>[813]</sup></a> earrings,<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c014'><sup>[814]</sup></a> and
circlets for the head. That these articles were usually
formed with much taste and elegance we may infer
from the fact, that artists of the greatest respectability
were employed to make designs for them, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>even the engravers of cups and goblets, as Mys, for
example, sometimes acquired great celebrity.<a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c014'><sup>[815]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The ancients understood well the art of washing
and plating articles formed of the inferior metals with
gold and silver, as well as many ingenious devices
for soldering, mixing, varying the colours, frosting
the surface, and inlaying and flowering one metal
with another. Statues in Attica were commonly
lacquered with gold;<a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c014'><sup>[816]</sup></a> and, from the remotest antiquity,
the art of gilding appears to have flourished
in Greece, since we find mention of it in Homer,
who speaks of gilding<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c014'><sup>[817]</sup></a> the horns of victims offered
up to the gods. The ancients, unquestionably, employed
much thicker gold leaf in this process than
the moderns; from which it has been inferred, that
they were incapable of reducing it to greater tenuity.
But, besides that, when the leaves were too thin,
the quicksilver which they employed as a glue appeared
through, and dimmed the splendour of the
gold, they seem to have aimed at that very duration
which causes us to admire the fragments of
their gilding that still exist:—in the subterraneous
chambers, for example, of the Villa Borghese on the
Palatine hill, where the figures in gold scattered
over a ground of celestial blue, look as fresh as if
just laid on.<a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c014'><sup>[818]</sup></a> Metals of all kinds were likewise gilt—as
copper, and silver, and bronze. In gilding marble
the leaf was attached to the stone with white of egg,
which was likewise employed, instead of quicksilver,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>by dishonest workmen, who could thus make use of
a much thinner leaf.<a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c014'><sup>[819]</sup></a> The moderns in gilding marble
substitute the juice of garlic and figs. The practice
of gilding wood and leather was also common in antiquity,
as we find mention of gilt wooden statues
and beads,<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c014'><sup>[820]</sup></a> and harness, and sandal-thongs. The
walls and roofs of chambers were covered, moreover,
with gilding, and this ornament was laid as well on
wainscot as stucco.<a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c014'><sup>[821]</sup></a> The conjecture of a modern
writer,<a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c014'><sup>[822]</sup></a> that the ancients were acquainted with
the art of gilding in ormolu seems to be unfounded.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the minor, but most flourishing, branches
of the goldsmiths’ trade seems to have been the
making and setting of rings,<a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c014'><sup>[823]</sup></a> for which the Greeks
indulged an extraordinary fondness. They accordingly
had them of every form and material. Some persons,
for example, wore a plain gold, or silver, or even
iron, hoop; others a silver ring encircled by a narrow
band of gold, or a gold ring with a band of silver,
or an iron ring inlaid with gold.<a id='r824' /><a href='#f824' class='c014'><sup>[824]</sup></a> Some persons were
satisfied with a bronze ring, or one of gilt iron,<a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c014'><sup>[825]</sup></a>
which they wore apparently in memory of Prometheus,
who, to preserve Zeus’ word unbroken, was
fabled to bear on his finger an iron ring set with a
piece of Caucasian stone as a signet, so that, by a
divine sort of quibble, he might for ever be said to
be chained to Caucasus.<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c014'><sup>[826]</sup></a> Others, again, delighted
in rings of amber,<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c014'><sup>[827]</sup></a> white or yellow, or ivory, or porcelain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>at least these were fashionable in Egypt. Sometimes,
they wore silver rings with signets of gold,
or the contrary. Mention, too, is made of a ring
formed entirely of carnelian, which, to preserve it,
was encircled by a narrow hoop of silver, and set
with a golden signet.<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c014'><sup>[828]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Jugglers sold to persons of large faith rings<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c014'><sup>[829]</sup></a> that
would cure the colic;<a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c014'><sup>[830]</sup></a> and articles of this description
with magic and talismanic virtues appear to
have been at all times abundant and in great request.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of signets<a id='r831' /><a href='#f831' class='c014'><sup>[831]</sup></a> the most ancient would appear to
have been small bits of wood, which, having been
worm-eaten in a grotesque or fanciful manner,<a id='r832' /><a href='#f832' class='c014'><sup>[832]</sup></a> were
cut and polished, and used by some rough Thane
for a crest, in memory of which practice precious
stones were in after ages engraved so as to imitate
exactly these rude materials.<a id='r833' /><a href='#f833' class='c014'><sup>[833]</sup></a> In process of time
nearly every variety of precious stone<a id='r834' /><a href='#f834' class='c014'><sup>[834]</sup></a> came to be
engraved for rings and seals.<a id='r835' /><a href='#f835' class='c014'><sup>[835]</sup></a> Of these the most
remarkable was the carbuncle, in colour like a ripe
mulberry, which when held up in the sun glows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>like a flame or burning coal,<a id='r836' /><a href='#f836' class='c014'><sup>[836]</sup></a> probably the reason
why it was supposed to shine in the dark like a
lamp.<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c014'><sup>[837]</sup></a> Under this name many gems known at
present by different appellations seem to have been
included, as the ruby,<a id='r838' /><a href='#f838' class='c014'><sup>[838]</sup></a> whose proper colour is a cochineal
red of surpassing richness, admitting, however,
occasionally, various intermixtures of blue, producing
the rose-red ruby, the former of a full carmine,
or rose colour, the latter tinged with a mixture of
blue; the rubacelle whose glowing red is dashed
with a cast of yellow; the true and the sorane garnet;
the rock ruby of a violet red; the almandine and
the hyacinth, now confounded with the amethyst.
Next to the above was the carnelian<a id='r839' /><a href='#f839' class='c014'><sup>[839]</sup></a> of a deep
ensanguined hue, chiefly obtained from the island
of Sardinia: the jasper of a dark green, with spots
of many colours, the sapphire blue bespangled with
gold.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another gem held in high estimation by the ancients
was the emerald,<a id='r840' /><a href='#f840' class='c014'><sup>[840]</sup></a> the exquisite colour of
which, generally the most intense green, was supposed
to be more grateful to the eye than the sight
of vernal woods or meadows. For this reason many
persons selected it for seals in preference to all
other stones.<a id='r841' /><a href='#f841' class='c014'><sup>[841]</sup></a> Even the lapidaries employed in
cutting it were believed to have their vision improved
by its refreshing virtues. All emeralds,
however, are not of one hue, but exhibit every
possible shade of green, from the dusky tint of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>olive leaf to the pale verdure of the acacia.<a id='r842' /><a href='#f842' class='c014'><sup>[842]</sup></a> The
Greek jewellers appear to have judged of the genuineness
of this stone by plunging it into clear water:
for if it were a true emerald it would, they thought,
impart its colour to the whole of the surrounding
element; if not, a small part only of it would be
tinged.<a id='r843' /><a href='#f843' class='c014'><sup>[843]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The ancients possessed a species of bastard emerald,
found in vast blocks, so that we read of an
emerald obelisk in Egypt, which, though consisting
of but four pieces, rose to the height of sixty feet.<a id='r844' /><a href='#f844' class='c014'><sup>[844]</sup></a>
Of this stone, probably, was the famous pillar which
adorned the entrance of the temple of Heracles at
Tyre.<a id='r845' /><a href='#f845' class='c014'><sup>[845]</sup></a> Of real emeralds the largest known does
not exceed six inches in length, and two in diameter.
It may be observed, that much pains and labour
were expended in bringing the emerald to its lustre.<a id='r846' /><a href='#f846' class='c014'><sup>[846]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The lyncurios or modern hyacinth is enumerated
among the seal gems.<a id='r847' /><a href='#f847' class='c014'><sup>[847]</sup></a> Its colour is that of flame
with an intermixture of deep red, though it is sometimes
found of a full saffron hue, or even resembling
amber. It has by several writers been supposed
to be the tourmaline. The lyncurios was exceedingly
hard and difficult to work. They likewise cut
and engraved for seals the amber, which Theophrastus
describes as a native mineral; the hyaloides, the
omphax, the crystal,<a id='r848' /><a href='#f848' class='c014'><sup>[848]</sup></a> the sardonyx, the agate, the
onyx, and the amethyst.<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c014'><sup>[849]</sup></a> A gem of extraordinary
beauty was once found in the gold mines of Lampsacos,
which, having been engraved by a Tyrian lapidary,
was presented to the Persian King.<a id='r850' /><a href='#f850' class='c014'><sup>[850]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Respecting the various processes by which precious
stones were engraved, the ancients have left us but
a few scattered hints. It appears certain, however,
that they polished precious stones with emery,<a id='r851' /><a href='#f851' class='c014'><sup>[851]</sup></a> and
possessed the lapidary’s wheel, with all the finer
tools at present in use, including the diamond point,<a id='r852' /><a href='#f852' class='c014'><sup>[852]</sup></a>
which there is reason to believe they likewise fixed
on the wheel.<a id='r853' /><a href='#f853' class='c014'><sup>[853]</sup></a> At any rate, they contrived with
the instruments they possessed to engrave figures,
as of lions, heroes, bacchantes, caryatides, trophies,<a id='r854' /><a href='#f854' class='c014'><sup>[854]</sup></a>
both in relief and intaglio, which for beauty and
delicacy have never yet been equalled. It was at
one time a question whether or not they were acquainted
with the microscope,<a id='r855' /><a href='#f855' class='c014'><sup>[855]</sup></a>—though how they
could engrave without it figures which we require
its assistance distinctly to perceive, seems somewhat
difficult to comprehend. The gem, for example,

  <h3 id='ch6.4' class='c012'>CHAPTER IV. <br /> INDUSTRY: SMITHS, CUTLERS, ARMOURERS, THE ART OF MINING, CHARCOAL-MAKING, ETC.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The earliest smiths<a id='r863' /><a href='#f863' class='c014'><sup>[863]</sup></a> in Greece wrought not in
iron but in brass, of which, at first, both arms and
domestic implements were fashioned. In Mexico
and Peru, where, likewise, copper<a id='r864' /><a href='#f864' class='c014'><sup>[864]</sup></a> was known before
iron, they possessed the art of hardening it to
so great a degree, that it would even cut stones
and the closest-grained wood. The same or a similar
process was known to the ancients, and might still,
perhaps, be easily recovered were it any longer an
object to be desired. The Greeks always retained
a strong partiality for articles of brass, copper, and
bronze, and besides statues,<a id='r865' /><a href='#f865' class='c014'><sup>[865]</sup></a> pillars,<a id='r866' /><a href='#f866' class='c014'><sup>[866]</sup></a> and trees, where
the fruit was sometimes of gold,<a id='r867' /><a href='#f867' class='c014'><sup>[867]</sup></a> employed them in
cups, urns, vases, and caldrons, with covers of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>same metal.<a id='r868' /><a href='#f868' class='c014'><sup>[868]</sup></a> We also find mention made of brazen
mangers, and even maps.<a id='r869' /><a href='#f869' class='c014'><sup>[869]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With tin, also, the Greeks, even in the Homeric
age, were acquainted;<a id='r870' /><a href='#f870' class='c014'><sup>[870]</sup></a> and, among other uses which
they, in later ages, made of it, was that of lining
the inside of their cooking utensils.<a id='r871' /><a href='#f871' class='c014'><sup>[871]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At a period beyond the reach of history they obtained
a knowledge of the use of both iron<a id='r872' /><a href='#f872' class='c014'><sup>[872]</sup></a> and
steel, the invention of which they attributed to Hephaistos.<a id='r873' /><a href='#f873' class='c014'><sup>[873]</sup></a>
Homer, who speaks of axes and other
implements of steel, or, rather, of iron steeled at
the edge, describes the process of forming it by immersion
in cold water.<a id='r874' /><a href='#f874' class='c014'><sup>[874]</sup></a> In the manufacture of the
Homeric swords steel only would appear to have
been, in most cases, employed, since they were extremely
brittle, and often shivered to pieces by a
mere blow upon shield or helmet. To guard against
this effect the superior and more delicate articles
were, in later times, cooled not in water but in oil.<a id='r875' /><a href='#f875' class='c014'><sup>[875]</sup></a>
The Spartans, we are told, quenched their iron money
in vinegar which rendered it, they supposed, brittle
and unmalleable, consequently of no value but as
a token.<a id='r876' /><a href='#f876' class='c014'><sup>[876]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the earliest nations who excelled in the
smelting of iron and the manufacture of steel were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the Chalybes,<a id='r877' /><a href='#f877' class='c014'><sup>[877]</sup></a> who are said to have collected the
ore from the beds of their rivers, and to have mingled
therewith a certain quantity of the mineral pyrimachos.
Aristotle, in describing the process of smelting,
observes, that steel, in passing through the furnace,
not only diminishes in quantity but in specific
gravity also, that is to say, becomes less valuable.
It was one merit of the Chalybean steel that it was
not liable to rust. The method of preparing this
metal which prevailed among the Celtiberians was
this:<a id='r878' /><a href='#f878' class='c014'><sup>[878]</sup></a> they buried a number of iron plates in the
earth, where they suffered them to remain until the
greater portion was converted into rust.<a id='r879' /><a href='#f879' class='c014'><sup>[879]</sup></a> They then
drew them forth and wrought them into various kinds
of weapons, particularly swordblades, which were so
keen that neither shields, nor helmets, nor sculls,
were able to resist their edge. To this the complimentary
Plutarch likens the language of the Spartans.<a id='r880' /><a href='#f880' class='c014'><sup>[880]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was thought of much importance by the ancients
to select for the quenching of steel water
possessing certain occult qualities, whose existence
was only to be detected by experiment. By these
the river of the Chalybeans was thought to be distinguished,<a id='r881' /><a href='#f881' class='c014'><sup>[881]</sup></a>
as well as the waters near Como, at
Calatayud and Tarragona in Spain. Water has, likewise,
been prepared, by a variety of infusions, for
communicating a finer temper and greater hardness
to steel, an example of which is mentioned in the
history of the Duke Cosmo, who invented, according
to Vasari,<a id='r882' /><a href='#f882' class='c014'><sup>[882]</sup></a> a liquid wherein were hardened the tools
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>with which Francesco del Tadda was enabled to cut
a fountain-basin, and several other articles, from a
block of the hardest porphyry. Nothing, however,
was more common than this operation among the
ancients, both Greeks and Egyptians, by whom porphyry
was cut into every variety of form, and invested
with the highest polish.<a id='r883' /><a href='#f883' class='c014'><sup>[883]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The best steel appears to have been obtained from
the Seres, from Parthia, and from India,<a id='r884' /><a href='#f884' class='c014'><sup>[884]</sup></a> where,
when polished, it assumed the bright appearance of
silver, and probably like that of Damascus contained
a small proportion of this metal. That which came
from Sinope and the Chalybes served for the manufacture
of ordinary tools; the Laconian<a id='r885' /><a href='#f885' class='c014'><sup>[885]</sup></a> was
wrought into files, augers, chisels, and the other
implements of stone-cutters; the Lydian stood in
high estimation with the sword-cutlers, and the manufacturers
of razors and surgical instruments.<a id='r886' /><a href='#f886' class='c014'><sup>[886]</sup></a> The
locks and keys<a id='r887' /><a href='#f887' class='c014'><sup>[887]</sup></a> of the ancients, if we may judge
from the specimens found at Pompeii, were of a
somewhat rude construction, though probably manufactured
of the best iron.</p>

<p class='c001'>The workshop and tools of the smith bore the
closest possible resemblance to those of the present
day; the bellows<a id='r888' /><a href='#f888' class='c014'><sup>[888]</sup></a> consisting of thin boards connected
by flaps of cow-hide, and having a snout of iron,
the anvil mounted on a high block, the hammer,
the tongs, the vice, which require no particular description.</p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting the quality of Grecian cutlery it must
be acknowledged that our information is exceedingly
scanty, though we may reasonably infer, that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>often possessed the greatest excellence and beauty
from the perfection to which they had undoubtedly
brought the manufacture of arms. In this branch
of industry the Delphians would seem to have obtained
celebrity, though the form and uses of their
knives, alluded to in a comparison by Aristotle,<a id='r889' /><a href='#f889' class='c014'><sup>[889]</sup></a>
can be looked upon only as matter of conjecture.
It seems to me, that, like Hudibras’ dagger, they
would serve for a variety of purposes, as a poignard
for example, as a sacrificial instrument, and as a
common knife:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When it had stabbed, or broke a head,</div>
      <div class='line'>It would scrape trenchers or chip bread,</div>
      <div class='line'>Toast cheese or bacon, though it were</div>
      <div class='line'>To bait a mousetrap ’twould not care.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>There was a very elegant sort of knives among
the Athenians, adorned with ivory handles, delicately
carved with the figures of animals, among which
was that of a crouching lioness.<a id='r890' /><a href='#f890' class='c014'><sup>[890]</sup></a> For this purpose
the ivory was frequently stained of different colours,
as pink, or crimson, or purple, according to the fancy
of the workman. Knife-handles were sometimes also
made of the roots of the lotos,<a id='r891' /><a href='#f891' class='c014'><sup>[891]</sup></a> which, no doubt,
took a fine polish and were beautifully clouded.
Their scissors, bodkins, sailmakers’ needles, common
needles, pins,<a id='r892' /><a href='#f892' class='c014'><sup>[892]</sup></a> and other articles of this description,
would seem to have been manufactured
with much neatness.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the most flourishing trade in Greece was
probably that of the armourer,<a id='r893' /><a href='#f893' class='c014'><sup>[893]</sup></a> which, at almost
every period of her history, was in constant request.
Many, probably, of the useful arts owed much of
the progress they made to the passion of the Greeks
for arms, which led them industriously to study and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>invent whatever could add to their splendour or efficiency.
We need not now go back to the times
when sticks and stones and pointed reeds formed the
national weapons.<a id='r894' /><a href='#f894' class='c014'><sup>[894]</sup></a> Among the very first steps in
civilisation were improvements in the art of self-defence;
for, wherever men have found it necessary
to create property, they have felt it to be equally
so to invent weapons for protecting themselves in
the enjoyment of it. Accordingly the Greeks, long
before the birth of history, had surrounded themselves
by numerous instruments of destruction, and
learned to cover their bodies with armour infinitely
varied in materials and workmanship.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon none of their weapons, however, did they
bestow greater attention than on the sword, which
if it did not, as among certain barbarians, constitute
one of the objects of their worship,<a id='r895' /><a href='#f895' class='c014'><sup>[895]</sup></a> was in most
cases their inseparable companion through life, and
descended with them even to the grave. Thus we
find, that, when Cimon opened, at Scyros, the grave
of Theseus, the national hero of Attica, he found
beside the skeleton a spearhead and sword of
brass.<a id='r896' /><a href='#f896' class='c014'><sup>[896]</sup></a> Their blades were of many different shapes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and dimensions: they had the long, sharp, double-edged
rapier; the short cut and thrust; the crooked
scimitar, the sabre, and the broad-sword.<a id='r897' /><a href='#f897' class='c014'><sup>[897]</sup></a> These
were generally of the finest steel, highly polished,
and sometimes damaskened exactly like those blades
afterwards manufactured at Damascus. The sheath
was sometimes of ivory, sometimes of gold or silver
or tin or other inferior metal.<a id='r898' /><a href='#f898' class='c014'><sup>[898]</sup></a> To the first-mentioned
substance we have an allusion in a saying
of Diogenes, who on hearing a handsome young
man make use of low language, exclaimed: “How
shameless! to draw forth a sword of lead from a
sheath of ivory.”<a id='r899' /><a href='#f899' class='c014'><sup>[899]</sup></a> The hilts were often extremely
superb, of costly materials, and wrought in the most
fanciful shapes. We read, for example, of sword-handles
studded or inlaid with gold, or even composed
entirely of that metal, or of silver.<a id='r900' /><a href='#f900' class='c014'><sup>[900]</sup></a> Ivory
too, and amber,<a id='r901' /><a href='#f901' class='c014'><sup>[901]</sup></a> and terebinth,<a id='r902' /><a href='#f902' class='c014'><sup>[902]</sup></a> polished and black
as ebony, and a variety of other woods and substances,
stained black with nut-gall,<a id='r903' /><a href='#f903' class='c014'><sup>[903]</sup></a> were employed
for this purpose. The father of Demosthenes, who
kept a large manufactory of arms, left behind him a
considerable quantity of ivory and gall-nuts<a id='r904' /><a href='#f904' class='c014'><sup>[904]</sup></a> which he
had purchased as well for his own use as to supply
other armourers in a smaller way. Of daggers there
were various kinds, some of a larger size, worn suspended
on the thigh with the sword, as the hunting
knife was by the Persian youth; others much
smaller, which seem to have been carried about concealed
under the armpit, as is still the fashion in
the East. To this practice Socrates alludes in his
conversation with Polos of Agrigentum,<a id='r905' /><a href='#f905' class='c014'><sup>[905]</sup></a> on the
power possessed in states by tyrants, whom he compares
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>to one who should go forth into the marketplace
with an enchiridion concealed about him, and
for that reason fancy it in his power to take away
every man’s life, because he could undoubtedly kill
any one he pleased.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next in importance perhaps was the manufacture of
javelins and spears.<a id='r906' /><a href='#f906' class='c014'><sup>[906]</sup></a> Of the former, the heads,<a id='r907' /><a href='#f907' class='c014'><sup>[907]</sup></a> light
though sometimes broad, were mounted on slender
ashen shafts shod with iron, or on the long Cretan
reed<a id='r908' /><a href='#f908' class='c014'><sup>[908]</sup></a> which abounded in the marshes about Haliartos
in Bœotia. These javelins, in more modern
times, were furnished with a looped thong, by which
when the darter had missed his aim, they could be
drawn back.<a id='r909' /><a href='#f909' class='c014'><sup>[909]</sup></a> The best kind were supposed to be
manufactured in Bœotia. Spear-shafts were likewise
sometimes of ash,<a id='r910' /><a href='#f910' class='c014'><sup>[910]</sup></a> but more frequently of cornel
wood,<a id='r911' /><a href='#f911' class='c014'><sup>[911]</sup></a> and occasionally, as in the case of the Macedonian
sarissa, eighteen feet long. Like the javelin,
the spear also was shod sharp with iron, in order
the more easily to be fixed upright in the earth,
when soldiers slept abroad in the fields.<a id='r912' /><a href='#f912' class='c014'><sup>[912]</sup></a> This part
of the iron-work, which was hollow and received
the shaft into it, is said to have been shaped like
a lizard, doubtless represented as holding the point
of the handle in its mouth. Projections resembling
legs extended on both sides, designed to prevent
the spear from sinking too deep into the ground.
In the lances of the cavalry there was, as some
suppose, a small notch to receive the point of the
horseman’s foot when mounting his steed. The
spear-head, generally of iron or steel, was among
the Arab allies of Xerxes formed of goat’s horn,
fashioned like the iron of a lance.<a id='r913' /><a href='#f913' class='c014'><sup>[913]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>The bows<a id='r914' /><a href='#f914' class='c014'><sup>[914]</sup></a> of the ancients were most commonly
composed of horn, tipped with gold or other metal
at either end. Among the barbarous nations there
were those who manufactured them of cane or palm-branches,
or even of the long stem of the date.<a id='r915' /><a href='#f915' class='c014'><sup>[915]</sup></a>
The bowstring was of thong or horse-hair. Reeds
generally constituted the shafts of their arrows,<a id='r916' /><a href='#f916' class='c014'><sup>[916]</sup></a> which
were headed with iron or copper, or hard pointed
stones, as those of the Arabs in the army of Xerxes,
who employed for this purpose the same stones
wherewith they engraved their seals.<a id='r917' /><a href='#f917' class='c014'><sup>[917]</sup></a> Arrows were
frequently winged with eagles’ feathers, and tinged at
the point with poison.<a id='r918' /><a href='#f918' class='c014'><sup>[918]</sup></a> In sieges they were often
armed with fire.<a id='r919' /><a href='#f919' class='c014'><sup>[919]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the above, there were several other implements
of destruction. The Greeks made use of
the club, the battle-axe, and the sling.<a id='r920' /><a href='#f920' class='c014'><sup>[920]</sup></a> And a
tribe of barbarians, once mentioned in history, depended
entirely on their daggers, and a noosed rope
of twisted thongs,<a id='r921' /><a href='#f921' class='c014'><sup>[921]</sup></a> which they used for entangling
and overthrowing man or horse, much in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>manner as the lasso is now employed in the Pampas
of South America.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we turn now to their armour, we shall find
that they displayed in its manufacture the greatest
possible skill, taste, and ingenuity. Their helmets,
cuirasses, shields, cuisses, and greaves, were made of
polished steel, or brass, or tin, sometimes curiously
figured, and inlaid with metals of many different
colours, and polished to an exceeding brightness,<a id='r922' /><a href='#f922' class='c014'><sup>[922]</sup></a>
sometimes adorned with representations in relief.
Frequently they went cased in shirts of mail, composed
of innumerable small metallic plates, lapping
over each other so as to resemble the scales of fishes.
Occasionally the opulent appeared on the field of
battle in golden armour,<a id='r923' /><a href='#f923' class='c014'><sup>[923]</sup></a> though this piece of ostentation
was chiefly confined to the barbarians.<a id='r924' /><a href='#f924' class='c014'><sup>[924]</sup></a> The
armourers’ craft, however, seems to have gone on
improving in proportion as the courage of the nation
deteriorated, until at length, in Macedonian times,
armour of enormous weight, and, literally, impenetrable,
came into use. Thus Zoilos manufactured
for Demetrios Poliorcetes two coats-of-mail,<a id='r925' /><a href='#f925' class='c014'><sup>[925]</sup></a> of a steel
so hard, that the surface could scarcely be grazed
by an arrow discharged from a catapult. The whole
suit weighed no less than one hundred and thirty
pounds, exactly twice as much as an ordinary suit
of armour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Helmets<a id='r926' /><a href='#f926' class='c014'><sup>[926]</sup></a> were manufactured of numerous materials.
First, in the ruder ages, they were in reality
nothing more than so many close skull-caps made of
the skins<a id='r927' /><a href='#f927' class='c014'><sup>[927]</sup></a> of otters or water-dogs, with the hair on,<a id='r928' /><a href='#f928' class='c014'><sup>[928]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>or foxes, or weasels, or goats, or bulls, or lions. But
as the arts of civilisation improved, metal casques
were soon substituted for these primitive defences,
some of which, of wrought steel, were highly polished,
and shone like burnished silver. That of Alexander
was manufactured by Theophilos.<a id='r929' /><a href='#f929' class='c014'><sup>[929]</sup></a> The helmet consisted
of a variety of parts: as, first, the casque itself,
inlaid with brass and iron,<a id='r930' /><a href='#f930' class='c014'><sup>[930]</sup></a> which enclosed and defended
the head, the front brim projecting over the forehead;
the vizor, which dropped over the whole face;
the strap, often richly embroidered or studded with
jewels,<a id='r931' /><a href='#f931' class='c014'><sup>[931]</sup></a> passing under the chin; and the ridge, or
cone, on the summit, from which rose the plumes,
or crest.<a id='r932' /><a href='#f932' class='c014'><sup>[932]</sup></a> This crest, double, treble, or even quadruple,
according to the taste or fancy of the wearer,
sometimes consisted of long drooping ostrich feathers,<a id='r933' /><a href='#f933' class='c014'><sup>[933]</sup></a>
sometimes of horse-hair, either black or dyed of different
colours, which, trembling and floating over
the warrior’s head, appeared to augment his stature
while it added to the terror of his aspect. King
Pyrrhos, we are told, wore upon his helmet the horns
of a goat, symbolical of the power of Macedon;<a id='r934' /><a href='#f934' class='c014'><sup>[934]</sup></a>
and the Asiatic Thracians flanked their crests with
the horns and ears of an ox in brass.<a id='r935' /><a href='#f935' class='c014'><sup>[935]</sup></a> To break
the force of blows from clubs or heavy battle-axes,
the crown of the helmet was thickly lined with
sponge or soft wool.<a id='r936' /><a href='#f936' class='c014'><sup>[936]</sup></a> Mention is likewise made of
helmets of plaited cord of wood and leather,<a id='r937' /><a href='#f937' class='c014'><sup>[937]</sup></a> and the
skins of horses’ heads, retaining the ears and the mane.<a id='r938' /><a href='#f938' class='c014'><sup>[938]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the manufacture of corslets and cuirasses<a id='r939' /><a href='#f939' class='c014'><sup>[939]</sup></a> much
industry and ability was exhibited. The former were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>generally composed of linen or hempen twine curiously
wrought, and doubled or trebled according to
the desire of the purchaser,<a id='r940' /><a href='#f940' class='c014'><sup>[940]</sup></a> and worn chiefly in the
chase;<a id='r941' /><a href='#f941' class='c014'><sup>[941]</sup></a> others consisted of thick leathern jerkins, covered
with metallic scales,<a id='r942' /><a href='#f942' class='c014'><sup>[942]</sup></a> single, double, or treble,
and fastened to each other by a series of hooks.
In lieu of these plates was sometimes substituted
a coating of intertwisted rings, resembling in some
respects the chain armour of a later age. Wooden
cuirasses were also sometimes worn.<a id='r943' /><a href='#f943' class='c014'><sup>[943]</sup></a> The Sarmatians<a id='r944' /><a href='#f944' class='c014'><sup>[944]</sup></a>
possessing no iron, headed their darts and
javelins with bone, and employed very extraordinary
materials in the manufacture of their cuirasses.
Collecting carefully all the hoofs of such horses as
died, they cut them into laminæ, resembling in form
the scales of a fish. These they sewed together with
the nerves of horses or oxen, and thus produced a
species of breastplate which for elegance and utility
was scarcely inferior to those of the Greeks. In
the manufacture of linen corslets<a id='r945' /><a href='#f945' class='c014'><sup>[945]</sup></a> the Egyptians
displayed peculiar excellence, at least the description
of one of them which history has preserved is
calculated to create a very high idea of their ingenuity.
It was curiously wrought, we are told, with
fine bobbins, each composed of three hundred and
sixty threads, distinctly visible, adorned with numerous
figures of animals interwoven with cotton and
gold.<a id='r946' /><a href='#f946' class='c014'><sup>[946]</sup></a> Among the Greeks this piece of armour was
often richly embroidered by the ladies of the warrior’s
family, whom, on more than one occasion, we find
busy at this task on the eve of battle. The cuirasses
of brass or steel were finely polished and buttoned
under the arm. Even the horses were furnished
with breastplates and frontlets,<a id='r947' /><a href='#f947' class='c014'><sup>[947]</sup></a> and occasionally
their flanks also were protected by armour. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>warrior’s greaves<a id='r948' /><a href='#f948' class='c014'><sup>[948]</sup></a> were manufactured of copper, brass,
tin, or other metal, and fastened about the legs with
silver buttons. Archers seem commonly to have
worn a species of gloves or fingerlings.<a id='r949' /><a href='#f949' class='c014'><sup>[949]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The manufacture of shields<a id='r950' /><a href='#f950' class='c014'><sup>[950]</sup></a> underwent great fluctuations
at different periods of Grecian history, and
even in the same age there existed numerous and
extraordinary differences in their materials, form,
and structure. In early times they consisted simply
of a piece of circular basket-work, plaited for the
sake of lightness with vine-branches<a id='r951' /><a href='#f951' class='c014'><sup>[951]</sup></a> or willows; or
were made of a solid piece of wood scooped into
the proper form, and covered with one or more coats
of leather. The wood usually preferred for this use
was that of the elder, the beach, the poplar, and the
fig; and the leather was generally tough bull-hide,<a id='r952' /><a href='#f952' class='c014'><sup>[952]</sup></a>
with or without the hair, though we read of nations,
as the Ethiopians, who made use for this purpose of
the skins of cranes.<a id='r953' /><a href='#f953' class='c014'><sup>[953]</sup></a> The same people at the present
day have discovered that the hide of the crocodile,
dressed with the scales on, forms a better integument
for their bucklers. Among the Homeric heroes the
wooden framework was protected by many folds of
leather, amounting sometimes to seven, to which
were added plates of brass, silver, gold, or tin. Even
when the face of the shield was composed of some
inferior metal, the rim seems frequently to have
been of gold.</p>

<p class='c001'>In later times shields were usually manufactured
of brass or steel, wrought and fashioned with the
greatest care, and polished like a mirror. Occasionally,
likewise, they were inlaid with purple, ivory,
and gold,<a id='r954' /><a href='#f954' class='c014'><sup>[954]</sup></a> or painted white, or crusted with gold and
silver, as among the Samnites.<a id='r955' /><a href='#f955' class='c014'><sup>[955]</sup></a> From the remotest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>antiquity, moreover, it was customary to paint upon
shields a number of devices, each warrior selecting
one for himself,<a id='r956' /><a href='#f956' class='c014'><sup>[956]</sup></a> which, like the armorial bearings
of the knights of chivalry, distinguished him from
his comrades in battle. Thus Perseus chose the head
of the Gorgon Medusa;<a id='r957' /><a href='#f957' class='c014'><sup>[957]</sup></a> Tydeus the aspect of the face
of the mighty heavens, including the full moon, surrounded
by flaming stars;<a id='r958' /><a href='#f958' class='c014'><sup>[958]</sup></a> Eteocles bore before him
the figure of a warrior scaling a lofty tower, while
Hippomedon selected, as the emblem of his character,
the figure of Typhœos breathing forth fire and smoke.
Every reader will remember the varied imagery that
crowded the shield of the Homeric Achilles, together
with the scenes which Hesiod, in imitation, depicts
on the buckler of Heracles. In the historical period<a id='r959' /><a href='#f959' class='c014'><sup>[959]</sup></a>
the people of Sicyon had a sigma, the initial letter
in the name of their capital, painted on their shields.<a id='r960' /><a href='#f960' class='c014'><sup>[960]</sup></a>
These ornaments, as well as the handles, it is said,
owed their origin to the invention of the Carians.
The form of the shield exhibited much variety. One
kind, for example, was small and circular,<a id='r961' /><a href='#f961' class='c014'><sup>[961]</sup></a> another
oblong or parallelogrammatic, and of dimensions so
large as to cover the whole body, and allow the
fallen warrior to be borne home on it as upon a bier;
others were rhomboidal,<a id='r962' /><a href='#f962' class='c014'><sup>[962]</sup></a> or semilunar, or shaped
like an ivy-leaf. But whatever may have been their
figure, there always projected from the centre of the
external face a large boss, with a smaller one, generally
pointed, on the middle of it. This the soldiers
dashed in the countenances of the enemy. Within,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>two bars, stretching from rim to rim, and crossing
each other like the letter X, gave the warrior, who
passed his left arm behind them, greater power over
his defence, while a smaller handle, on the fore part
of the shield, received his grasp.<a id='r963' /><a href='#f963' class='c014'><sup>[963]</sup></a> Occasionally, the
place of these bars was supplied by metallic or
wooden handles, exactly of a size to receive the
arm; and, by means of a leathern strap, the buckler,
when marching, was usually suspended on the shoulder.<a id='r964' /><a href='#f964' class='c014'><sup>[964]</sup></a>
In time of peace both the shield and the helmet
were laid up, each in its appropriate case.<a id='r965' /><a href='#f965' class='c014'><sup>[965]</sup></a> Besides
the manufacturers of arms, who supplied states
with large orders, there were numerous armourers
on a smaller scale,<a id='r966' /><a href='#f966' class='c014'><sup>[966]</sup></a> whose shops exhibited a rich and
varied assortment of shields, helmets, and every kind
of weapon.</p>

<p class='c001'>The metals employed in the fabrication of arms
were obtained partly from mines found in Greece
itself, partly by commerce from the surrounding
countries.<a id='r967' /><a href='#f967' class='c014'><sup>[967]</sup></a> On the methods of mining which prevailed
among the Greeks our information is peculiarly
scanty. We know, however, that, at Laurion,<a id='r968' /><a href='#f968' class='c014'><sup>[968]</sup></a>
the Athenians made use of both shafts and
adits, and that in chambering they employed much
timber.<a id='r969' /><a href='#f969' class='c014'><sup>[969]</sup></a> To prevent the falling in of the superincumbent
mountain there were left at intervals vast
pillars,<a id='r970' /><a href='#f970' class='c014'><sup>[970]</sup></a> the cutting away of which was by law prohibited
on pain of death. In the potter’s-clay mines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>of Samos, where the veins, running generally between
beds of rock, were exceedingly shallow, seldom
exceeding two feet in depth, the miners, as in
the thin veins of our own coal mines, were compelled
while at work to lie on their back or sides,
which, it may be presumed, was the practice in other
mines under similar circumstances. Whether they
possessed any means of protecting themselves against
the fire-damps or malaria,<a id='r971' /><a href='#f971' class='c014'><sup>[971]</sup></a> which, we know, prevailed
greatly at Laurion,<a id='r972' /><a href='#f972' class='c014'><sup>[972]</sup></a> is a matter of much uncertainty.
In Spain, the mines ran deep into the
earth, and were of prodigious extent, having transverse
passages and caverns of great dimensions and
elevation.</p>

<p class='c001'>In an old shaft discovered in the mountains of
Santo Spirito,<a id='r973' /><a href='#f973' class='c014'><sup>[973]</sup></a> the sides were supported by masonry;
large pools of water were found in some of the
chambers, while the explorers could hear afar off
the incessant roar of waterfalls. Here and there
the passages were nearly blocked up by masses of
gold and silver ore.<a id='r974' /><a href='#f974' class='c014'><sup>[974]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>How the water was drained off, or the ore brought
to the surface of the earth, no ancient author has
explained. When extracted, however, it was pounded
in a stone mortar with an iron pestle, then passed
through a sieve, and transferred to the smelting
furnace.<a id='r975' /><a href='#f975' class='c014'><sup>[975]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The account transmitted to us of the gold mines
of Egypt may probably throw some light on the
practice which prevailed among the Greeks. In
them we find an almost exact type of the degrading
toil and disregard of danger and decency recently
brought to light among our own subterranean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>population. There, indeed, the workmen were forced
to their task by the direct compulsion of a tyrannical
government; while in Great Britain the constraint
is enveloped by a cloud of circumstances
which conceal, though they scarcely soften, the stern
laws of necessity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Egyptian gold mines were situated in the
great eastern desert, on the shores of the Red Sea.
They had been worked from the remotest antiquity;
in proof of which it is related, that copper pickaxes
were frequently found in the deserted shafts and
galleries, beside incredible heaps of human bones,
relics of the multitudes who had perished there by
malaria, or fire-damps, or the falling of rocks, or
more probably from the incessant oppression to
which they were subjected.<a id='r976' /><a href='#f976' class='c014'><sup>[976]</sup></a> In fact the benevolent
historian,<a id='r977' /><a href='#f977' class='c014'><sup>[977]</sup></a> to whom we are indebted for nearly
all we know on this curious subject, felt so strongly
for the sufferings of these wretched artificers of Egyptian
grandeur, that he pronounced death in their
case to be more desirable than life.<a id='r978' /><a href='#f978' class='c014'><sup>[978]</sup></a> But the most
miserable possess resources and springs of gratification
unknown to philosophers and the professors of
literature; and, we may be sure, that even those
outcasts who brought up gold from the bowels of
the earth to adorn the thrones and palaces of the
Pharaohs, knew how to extract from their bitter
employment some few sweets of sufficient efficacy
to render life endurable.</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt the processes of those early times were
sufficiently rude. When about to open a new shaft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>or adit the Inspectors of the mines appear carefully
to have examined the different faces of the mountain,
sombre, scarped, and barren to the last degree;
and having fixed upon a spot in the face of some
cliff, the first operation was to render the rock friable
by the application of powerful fires, which were
kindled with wood at its base. The more robust
of the workmen then proceeded with their pickaxes
to the excavation of the galleries, which seldom or
never proceeded in a right line; but following the
direction of the metallic veins, mounted, descended,
branched off obliquely to the left or to the right;
and progressing in this manner, sometimes perforated
the whole bulk of the mountain, and striking downwards,
like the roots of trees, extended even to the
sea.<a id='r979' /><a href='#f979' class='c014'><sup>[979]</sup></a> The men employed in <em>getting</em> the ore, followed
incessantly by task-masters with instruments
of chastisement in their hands, were seldom permitted
to proportion their exertions to their strength;
but often toiled on apparently till they dropped,
when their bones joined the heaps of those who
had fallen before them. While thus engaged, more
especially when united in great numbers they had
clambered the rocks to a considerable height, they
presented an extraordinary spectacle; for each miner<a id='r980' /><a href='#f980' class='c014'><sup>[980]</sup></a>
carried a lamp bound to his forehead, though how,
when they bent or kneeled, or worked sideways, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>escaped being extinguished seems difficult of explanation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The laborious operation of collecting and <em>hurrying</em>
the ore was performed by boys of tender age, who
deposited it beyond the mouth of the shaft. Another
class of workmen, consisting chiefly of the
aged and the infirm, now bore the metalliferous
stones to that part of the works where the founders
were stationed. These were powerful and robust
men in the flower of their age, who, with large
stone mortars and iron pestles, reduced, under the
eye of rigid Inspectors, the ore to small fragments
not exceeding a vetch in size.<a id='r981' /><a href='#f981' class='c014'><sup>[981]</sup></a> This done, it was
transferred to the mills which were turned by women,
the wives and daughters of the miners, who, with the
exception of a slender covering about the waist, were
entirely naked, misery in all times and places rendering
people contemptuous of appearances and indifferent
to morality.<a id='r982' /><a href='#f982' class='c014'><sup>[982]</sup></a> These mills, heavy no doubt
and difficult to work, were turned by six women,
three on either side. They would appear, however,
to have answered well the purpose for which they
were designed, since the ore, we are told, was reduced
by them to the fineness of flour; after which
it was handed over to the Selangeus, the last link
in that long chain of operators which connected the
mine with the smelting furnace. The business of
the Selangeus consisted in separating the metal from
the matrix in which it had been produced. For
this purpose, the auriferous dust was cast in a heap
upon a broad polished board slightly inclined,<a id='r983' /><a href='#f983' class='c014'><sup>[983]</sup></a> and
there washed and triturated until the greater part
of the terrene particles had been, by soft sponges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>and water, separated from the gold, which was next
put into earthen vessels with small quantities of
lead, tin, salt, and barley-bran, and placed in the
smelting furnace, where it was subjected, for five
days and nights, to the flames. This done, the virgin
gold came forth glittering and pure as if it had
not been wrung from human agony or sullied by
human tears.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the smelting furnaces of Greece, notwithstanding
the doubts of Reitemeier, which Bœckh is contented
to combat with mere inferences,<a id='r984' /><a href='#f984' class='c014'><sup>[984]</sup></a> it is quite
certain that charcoal was used,<a id='r985' /><a href='#f985' class='c014'><sup>[985]</sup></a>—in the first smelting,
that of the aria, the arbutus, and the oak, of
which the last was least esteemed; and in the
second, that of the pitch-pine. In the iron mines
the charcoal of the Eubœan walnut-tree was preferred
for second smelting.</p>

<p class='c001'>This leads us to speak of the preparation of charcoal,
which was effected in the following manner:—having
excavated a circular cavity in the earth, they
pitched or paved it at bottom, and piling up to a
great height the billets of wood, which were selected
for their straightness in order that they might lie
as close as possible, covered over the whole with
earth and turf, so as to form a circular mound, like
a barrow. The heap was then set on fire, and the
covering pierced on all sides with spits, to provide
a vent for the smoke. The fire having been kept
burning for the proper time, which is not stated,
the charcoal was removed and laid by for use.<a id='r986' /><a href='#f986' class='c014'><sup>[986]</sup></a> Extensive
works of this kind were established at the
borough of Acharnè, in Attica, which was supplied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>with wood, chiefly the scarlet oak, from the forests
on Mount Parnes.<a id='r987' /><a href='#f987' class='c014'><sup>[987]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Much stress was laid by Hellenic artificers on the
materials from which the charcoal was manufactured:
thus smiths, braziers, and other handicraftsmen
preferred that of the pitch-pine to what was
made from the oak, because it exhibited a greater
tractability to the bellows, keeping up a more enduring
flame, and being less liable to sudden extinction,
though inferior in force. Generally, in fact,
all dry woods furnish a brisker and a brighter flame.
Twigs and small branches, as the Greek philosophers
had observed, yield, while burning, the fiercest heat;
but it was supposed that they were too deficient
in body to be profitably converted into charcoal.
In France, however, and other parts of the Continent,
we find twigs no bigger than goose-quills used
for this purpose. Some kinds of wood, it was observed,
produce in burning a far greater quantity of
smoke than others.<a id='r988' /><a href='#f988' class='c014'><sup>[988]</sup></a> Of these are all such as delight
in humid situations, as the platane and the willow,
with the black and white poplar. The vine,<a id='r989' /><a href='#f989' class='c014'><sup>[989]</sup></a> too,
while moist, stands in the same category, though
it yield the palm to the date-palm, which enjoyed
among the ancients the reputation of being the
smokiest tree that grows.<a id='r990' /><a href='#f990' class='c014'><sup>[990]</sup></a> In sharpness, however,
the smoke of the fig-tree was supposed to excel,
together with that of the wild fig-tree,<a id='r991' /><a href='#f991' class='c014'><sup>[991]</sup></a> and generally
all such natives of the forest as abound in a
milky juice. Nevertheless, having been barked,
steeped in running-water, and dried again,<a id='r992' /><a href='#f992' class='c014'><sup>[992]</sup></a> these
same kinds of wood were freer than all others from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>smoke, and yielded the softest and purest flame.<a id='r993' /><a href='#f993' class='c014'><sup>[993]</sup></a>
The same thing is remarked of wood which had been
washed with the lees of oil.<a id='r994' /><a href='#f994' class='c014'><sup>[994]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In Egypt, where charcoal is at present procured
chiefly from the wood of the acacia, and supplied
in most cases from the Desert, it was anciently prepared,
especially for the use of smiths, from the
long, tough, triangular roots of the sari,<a id='r995' /><a href='#f995' class='c014'><sup>[995]</sup></a> (Cyperus
fastigiatus,) which resembled those of the papyrus,
likewise burnt for fuel.<a id='r996' /><a href='#f996' class='c014'><sup>[996]</sup></a> The smiths of Hellas,<a id='r997' /><a href='#f997' class='c014'><sup>[997]</sup></a> however,
were not reduced to depend entirely upon
charcoal, since both in Liguria and Elis, on the
road, it has been conjectured, leading over Mount
Pholoë to Olympia,<a id='r998' /><a href='#f998' class='c014'><sup>[998]</sup></a> pits had been opened whence
the forges were supplied with fossil coal.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may here observe, by the way, that the ancients,
instead of flint and steel, or lucifer matches,
made use, in kindling a fire, of a curious apparatus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>still employed in the East:<a id='r999' /><a href='#f999' class='c014'><sup>[999]</sup></a> it consisted of two
parts, the one hollowed out like a diminutive mortar,
the other resembling a pestle, which was inserted
into it, and turned round with extreme velocity
until sparks were produced. This necessary
piece of furniture<a id='r1000' /><a href='#f1000' class='c014'><sup>[1000]</sup></a> was most commonly manufactured
of ivy, or laurel, or clematis, and was something of
the rhamnus ilex, or linden-tree; in short, of nearly
all trees, except the olive. Generally, however, it
was thought best to make the two parts of the instrument
of different kinds of wood. It was observed
that, with these contrivances, fire kindled
more readily during the prevalence of the north
than the south wind, and on high places than in
hollows. At Rome the vestal virgins originated the
sacred fire by means of a kind of mirror, and the
power of burning-glasses was not unknown.<a id='r1001' /><a href='#f1001' class='c014'><sup>[1001]</sup></a> Nay,
things resembling our lucifer matches were possessed
by certain jugglers, though they do not appear to
have passed into general use, either because the
inventors refused to divulge their secret, or from
the natural slowness of mankind to profit by useful
discoveries.<a id='r1002' /><a href='#f1002' class='c014'><sup>[1002]</sup></a></p>

The Parthian kings, we are told,
addicted themselves with pride
to the forging and sharpening of
arrow-heads: it may be presumed,
because the bow was the national
weapon of their country. Plut.
Demet. § 20. The arrow-heads
of the Indians were of unusually
large dimensions. Plut. Alexand.
§ 63. That the arrow-heads of
the ancient Scythians were of
bronze appears from the following
relation of Herodotus. Ariantas,
a king of Scythia, desirous of
ascertaining the number of his
subjects, commanded them, on
pain of death, to bring him each
an arrow-head. His people obeyed
the order; and when he had satisfied
himself respecting their number,
he ordered a huge vessel to
be cast with the bronze, which,
in the age of the Father of History,
still existed at a place called
Exampæos, between the Borysthenes
and the Hypanis. It was
six inches thick, and contained
six hundred amphoræ. iv. 81.</p>

was that of being rammed down
under the foundations of temples,
as in that of Artemis at Ephesos:
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rursus ne in lubrico atque instabili
fundamenta tantæ molis locarentur,
calcatis ea substravere
carbonibus dein velleribus lanæ.</span>
Plin. Nat. Hist. xxxvi. 21. On
the incorruptibility of charcoal,
St. Augustin, who loved to declaim
a little, thus writes:—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quid?
in carbonibus nonne miranda
est, et tanta infirmitas,
ut ictu levissimo frangantur,
pressu facillime conterantur: et
tanta firmitas ut nullo humore
corrumpantur, nulla ætate vincantur,
usque adeo ut eos substernere
soleant.... Quis eos in
terra humida effossos, ubi ligna
putrescerent, tamdiu durare incorruptibilior
posse, nisi rerum
ille corruptor ignis effecit?” De
Civitat. Dei,</span> xxxi. 4. The charcoal
was thus employed by the
advice of Theodoros, the son of
Rhæcos, the Samian. Οὗτος ἐστιν

<p class='c013'>Another flourishing branch of industry was that
of quarrying stones for building, carried on wherever
marble, or freestone, or tufa, or granite, was
found.<a id='r1003' /><a href='#f1003' class='c014'><sup>[1003]</sup></a> The stones were usually fashioned by the
axe, or saw,<a id='r1004' /><a href='#f1004' class='c014'><sup>[1004]</sup></a> in the quarry, and drawn thence by
ropes. In many cases, however, as where cheapness
or despatch was aimed at, bricks were substituted,<a id='r1005' /><a href='#f1005' class='c014'><sup>[1005]</sup></a>

<p class='c001'>In the preparation of mortar and cement the
Greeks exhibited extraordinary ingenuity.<a id='r1007' /><a href='#f1007' class='c014'><sup>[1007]</sup></a> They
made use, in the first place, of lime procured by
burning coarse marble in the ordinary way, or, secondly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>obtained from sea-shells, or stones picked up
on the banks of rivers. A superior kind of cement
was made from those stones used in the manufacture
of gypsum, which was so firm and durable, that it
was frequently found to outlast the materials which
it had been employed to unite. It was prepared by
being reduced to powder, and mixed with water,
and afterwards well stirred with a piece of wood,
since it was too hot to admit of the hands being
used. When removed from old walls it might be
burnt and prepared a second and a third time, as
originally from the stone.<a id='r1008' /><a href='#f1008' class='c014'><sup>[1008]</sup></a> This, in Syria and Phœnicia,
was used in facing the walls of houses, and in
Italy for whitening them, as well as in the making
of various mouldings and ornaments within.<a id='r1009' /><a href='#f1009' class='c014'><sup>[1009]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Frequently, also, it appears to have been employed
like plaster of Paris in the casting of statues,
as was that composed of powdered marble, in repairing
such as by accident had been broken. An
example of this was observed in the cheek of a
sphynx dug up in the island of Capri.<a id='r1010' /><a href='#f1010' class='c014'><sup>[1010]</sup></a> Instead of
water, however, a tough glue, composed of the hides
and horns of bulls, was employed in mixing it.<a id='r1011' /><a href='#f1011' class='c014'><sup>[1011]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the roofing of houses pantiles were commonly
made use of;<a id='r1012' /><a href='#f1012' class='c014'><sup>[1012]</sup></a> instead of which, as they were fragile
and easily broken by hailstones, tiles of Pentelic
marble, invented by Byzes of Naxos,<a id='r1013' /><a href='#f1013' class='c014'><sup>[1013]</sup></a> were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>often substituted in the case of temples, as that
for example of Zeus at Olympia. It is mentioned
incidentally by Dioscorides, that physicians used to
reduce acacia-wood to powder by burning it in the
tile-kilns.<a id='r1014' /><a href='#f1014' class='c014'><sup>[1014]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting the business of house-painters our information
is exceedingly scanty; we may infer,
however, that they excelled in the imitation of
woods and marbles, since they were employed in
imitating on the polished surface of one stone the
veins and colours characteristic of another.<a id='r1015' /><a href='#f1015' class='c014'><sup>[1015]</sup></a> Some
persons covered the walls of their apartments with
historical subjects,<a id='r1016' /><a href='#f1016' class='c014'><sup>[1016]</sup></a> or landscapes, or the figures of
animals in fresco.<a id='r1017' /><a href='#f1017' class='c014'><sup>[1017]</sup></a> In later ages ceilings were
painted, or inlaid with coloured stones,<a id='r1018' /><a href='#f1018' class='c014'><sup>[1018]</sup></a> or abaculi,
so as to imitate the feathers and hues of a peacock’s
tail.<a id='r1019' /><a href='#f1019' class='c014'><sup>[1019]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Timber for house-building,<a id='r1020' /><a href='#f1020' class='c014'><sup>[1020]</sup></a> the choice of which
was regulated by law,<a id='r1021' /><a href='#f1021' class='c014'><sup>[1021]</sup></a> abounded in most parts of
Greece, though the best and straightest was obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>from Macedonia and Arcadia,<a id='r1022' /><a href='#f1022' class='c014'><sup>[1022]</sup></a> particularly
from a hollow valley near a place called Cranè,
never visited by the sun, and fenced round by
rocks on all sides from the winds.<a id='r1023' /><a href='#f1023' class='c014'><sup>[1023]</sup></a> Very particular
rules were laid down respecting the time and manner
of felling trees;<a id='r1024' /><a href='#f1024' class='c014'><sup>[1024]</sup></a> first, wood cut in spring was
most easily barked; second, if this operation was
neglected it bred worms, which furrowed its whole
surface like written characters; third, such as was
cut when the moon was below the horizon was
thought harder and less liable to decay.<a id='r1025' /><a href='#f1025' class='c014'><sup>[1025]</sup></a> It may
here, perhaps, be worth observing, that stones and
other substances were often found grown into the
trunks of wild olive-trees. This was particularly
the case with that which grew in the market-place
of Megara. The oracle had foretold, that when this
tree should be cut down the city would be sacked
and destroyed, which was brought to pass by Demetrius.
On this occasion the tree being felled and
sawed into planks, greaves and other articles of
Athenian workmanship were found in the heart of
it.<a id='r1026' /><a href='#f1026' class='c014'><sup>[1026]</sup></a> Fragments of the timber remained in the time
of Theophrastus.</p>

<p class='c001'>In cutting hard wood carpenters made use of a
blunt axe,<a id='r1027' /><a href='#f1027' class='c014'><sup>[1027]</sup></a> which thus became sharper, while soft
wood produced the contrary effect.<a id='r1028' /><a href='#f1028' class='c014'><sup>[1028]</sup></a> It was customary
before timber was committed to the saw to
soak it for some time in water;<a id='r1029' /><a href='#f1029' class='c014'><sup>[1029]</sup></a> and it is said to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>have been rendered incombustible by a solution of
alum and certain kinds of vinegar.<a id='r1030' /><a href='#f1030' class='c014'><sup>[1030]</sup></a> The tools of
the Greek carpenter as near as possible resembled
our own; they had the saws small and great, the
plane, the axe, the chisel, the square, the gimlet,
the augur,<a id='r1031' /><a href='#f1031' class='c014'><sup>[1031]</sup></a> the compass,<a id='r1032' /><a href='#f1032' class='c014'><sup>[1032]</sup></a> and, in short, whatever
else could be useful in their trade. Among the
paintings of Herculaneum<a id='r1033' /><a href='#f1033' class='c014'><sup>[1033]</sup></a> we find the representation
of a carpenter’s workshop, where two winged
genii are busily employed with the mallet and the
saw. In making lines, &amp;c., they used the ruddle
now employed.<a id='r1034' /><a href='#f1034' class='c014'><sup>[1034]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the kinds of timber in most general use
was the silver fir, thought to be extremely durable,
in illustration of which Theophrastus relates the following
circumstance: it happened at Pheneos, in
Arcadia,<a id='r1035' /><a href='#f1035' class='c014'><sup>[1035]</sup></a> that, owing to the obstruction of the torrent-beds,
the plain was converted into a lake. To
traverse this they constructed bridges of fir, and
when the flood rose still higher, bridge upon bridge
was erected in succession. Afterwards when the
waters had worked themselves a passage and ebbed
off, the whole of the wood of these bridges was
found in the completest preservation.<a id='r1036' /><a href='#f1036' class='c014'><sup>[1036]</sup></a> The other
kinds of timber were the elm, used for doors, hinges,
and weasel traps;<a id='r1037' /><a href='#f1037' class='c014'><sup>[1037]</sup></a> the cypress,<a id='r1038' /><a href='#f1038' class='c014'><sup>[1038]</sup></a> cedar, and juniper
for wainscoting, beams, and paneled ceilings;
the Arcadian, and the Idæan yew,<a id='r1039' /><a href='#f1039' class='c014'><sup>[1039]</sup></a> which latter
was sometimes fraudulently substituted for cedar;
the Eub&oelig;an walnut, and the beech, which, not being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>subject to the rot, were resorted to for piles and
substructions.<a id='r1040' /><a href='#f1040' class='c014'><sup>[1040]</sup></a> The former of these trees, which
grew to an extraordinary size, was likewise applied
to the roofing of houses, chiefly because, by a loud
crackling noise, it gave notice when it was about
to break, and thus afforded the inmates leisure to
effect their escape. This happened at the public
baths of Antandros, where the company foreseeing
from this warning sound the catastrophe that was
approaching, rushed forth into the streets, and thus
avoided being overwhelmed beneath the ruins.<a id='r1041' /><a href='#f1041' class='c014'><sup>[1041]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The box, the ilex, and the lotos, they employed
for door-pivots, which were seasoned by being immersed
in cow-dung.<a id='r1042' /><a href='#f1042' class='c014'><sup>[1042]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Cart and wheel wrights,<a id='r1043' /><a href='#f1043' class='c014'><sup>[1043]</sup></a> necessarily pretty numerous,
made use in their trade of the following
kinds of wood,—the scarlet oak,<a id='r1044' /><a href='#f1044' class='c014'><sup>[1044]</sup></a> in countries not
abounding with ilex, as Laconia and Elis, for
carts, ploughs, and other rustic implements; the
oxya, the fir, and the elm, for chariot-bodies;<a id='r1045' /><a href='#f1045' class='c014'><sup>[1045]</sup></a>
the ilex, the box, the ash, and the mast-bearing
beech, for axletrees. The wood of all glutinous
trees is naturally flexible, but more especially that
of the mulberry and the wild fig, for which reason
these, together with the platane, and the poplar,
were used for making the bended rims of chariot-seats,
and the circles of wheels.<a id='r1046' /><a href='#f1046' class='c014'><sup>[1046]</sup></a> For spokes, the
wood of the cornel tree was preferred, and that of
the box, the yew, the maple, and the carpinus—hedge-beech,
or hornbeam—for the yokes of oxen.
In old times the bodies of carts were often formed
of basket-work. It may be remarked by the way,
that the Greeks understood the use of the drag-wheel.<a id='r1047' /><a href='#f1047' class='c014'><sup>[1047]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>It has long been made a question among the
learned<a id='r1048' /><a href='#f1048' class='c014'><sup>[1048]</sup></a> whether the ancients were or were not acquainted
with the saddle, properly so called. It may
now be determined in the affirmative, since, besides
the several testimonies of classical writers, which
are much too clear to be set aside, we find in
several Herculanean pictures exact representations
of saddles, both on horses and asses, with girths
and cruppers exactly as in modern times.<a id='r1049' /><a href='#f1049' class='c014'><sup>[1049]</sup></a> It is
evident, too, that they are constructed upon wooden
frames, to which Herodotus may possibly allude
where he speaks of saddles made of tanned human
skins.<a id='r1050' /><a href='#f1050' class='c014'><sup>[1050]</sup></a> Packsaddles for sumpter-asses are of constant
occurrence in history; and that they were
tolerably thick may be inferred from the fact, that
numbers of daggers were concealed in them by
Aratos in his attempt upon Argos.<a id='r1051' /><a href='#f1051' class='c014'><sup>[1051]</sup></a> I shall here
mention, also, by the way, and without entering
into any discussion, that horses and asses were occasionally
shod by the ancients,<a id='r1052' /><a href='#f1052' class='c014'><sup>[1052]</sup></a> though the practice
was doubtless not universal.</p>

<p class='c001'>The trade of the cooper<a id='r1053' /><a href='#f1053' class='c014'><sup>[1053]</sup></a> was in less general request
than in modern times; his principal employment
being the making of tubs, with flour and
water-casks; their wine having been chiefly preserved
in jars.<a id='r1054' /><a href='#f1054' class='c014'><sup>[1054]</sup></a> Latterly, however, small kegs got
into use, as well probably as larger casks even for
wine. Pump-makers, together with the pump itself,<a id='r1055' /><a href='#f1055' class='c014'><sup>[1055]</sup></a>
came in late, and of fire-engines they possessed
barely the first rudiments.<a id='r1056' /><a href='#f1056' class='c014'><sup>[1056]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In speaking elsewhere of the household furniture
of the Greeks we necessarily anticipated much of
what was to be said respecting cabinet-makers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>upholsterers. Some few particulars, however, omitted
in that place, shall be here introduced. With
respect to the price of furniture at Athens,<a id='r1057' /><a href='#f1057' class='c014'><sup>[1057]</sup></a> it seems
much better to be silent than by a few imperfect
conjectures to confine the mind of the reader. We
know absolutely nothing of the matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the Egyptians, the roots of the Persea,<a id='r1058' /><a href='#f1058' class='c014'><sup>[1058]</sup></a> a
beautiful fruit-tree, said to have been poisonous in
Persia,<a id='r1059' /><a href='#f1059' class='c014'><sup>[1059]</sup></a> furnished the materials not only of statues
but of bedsteads and tables, which were of a rich
dark colour and received a fine polish.<a id='r1060' /><a href='#f1060' class='c014'><sup>[1060]</sup></a> There was
likewise, in Syria, a species of wood the blackness
of which was interveined with ruddy streaks, so that
it looked like variegated ebony. From this were
manufactured bedsteads, chairs, and other expensive
articles of furniture.<a id='r1061' /><a href='#f1061' class='c014'><sup>[1061]</sup></a> The maple-tree grows both
on plains and mountains. In the latter situation
its wood is of a pleasant reddish colour, finely veined
and solid,<a id='r1062' /><a href='#f1062' class='c014'><sup>[1062]</sup></a> on which account it was much used in
superior cabinet-work. The zygian maple, in general
beautifully clouded, was so hard, that it required
to be steeped in water before it could be wrought.<a id='r1063' /><a href='#f1063' class='c014'><sup>[1063]</sup></a>
Of all woods the ancients considered that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>cypress<a id='r1064' /><a href='#f1064' class='c014'><sup>[1064]</sup></a> the most durable, and it is related in confirmation
of this opinion, that the doors of the
temple of Artemis at Ephesos, which were made
of it, had already lasted four centuries in the time
of Theophrastus.<a id='r1065' /><a href='#f1065' class='c014'><sup>[1065]</sup></a> It took the finest polish, and was
therefore employed in costly cabinet-work. The
wood of the tree called thuia (a species perhaps of
wild cypress), abounding in <a id='corr184.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Cyrene'>Cyrenè</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_184.8'><ins class='correction' title='Cyrene'>Cyrenè</ins></a></span>, and the Oasis
of Jupiter Ammon,<a id='r1066' /><a href='#f1066' class='c014'><sup>[1066]</sup></a> was thought to be incorruptible;
and from its roots, which were beautifully
clouded, the most delicate articles of furniture were
manufactured. Next to these the wood of the mulberry-tree
was preferred, which exhibited a dusky
grain like that of the lotos.<a id='r1067' /><a href='#f1067' class='c014'><sup>[1067]</sup></a> Expensive bedsteads
were sometimes made of oxya and citron-wood, the
feet of which, among the Persians, were often turned
from the wood of the doom-palm,<a id='r1068' /><a href='#f1068' class='c014'><sup>[1068]</sup></a> as they were
formed among the Greeks from amber.<a id='r1069' /><a href='#f1069' class='c014'><sup>[1069]</sup></a> Statues,<a id='r1070' /><a href='#f1070' class='c014'><sup>[1070]</sup></a>
which ought in truth to be regarded as articles of
furniture, were carved from cedar, cypress,<a id='r1071' /><a href='#f1071' class='c014'><sup>[1071]</sup></a> lotos,
box, and of a smaller size from the roots of olive-trees,
because they did not crack.<a id='r1072' /><a href='#f1072' class='c014'><sup>[1072]</sup></a> Besides these
which were perhaps the more common, we find mention
in ancient writers of images of ebony, oak, yew,
maple, beech, palm,<a id='r1073' /><a href='#f1073' class='c014'><sup>[1073]</sup></a> myrtle, pear, linden, and vine,
to which may be added the fig-tree which was frequently
preferred on account of its soft texture,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>lightness, shining whiteness, and close-grain. Occasionally
statues of horses were carved of ebony
and ivory. As during the prevalence of certain
winds several of these kinds of woods were liable
to sweat,<a id='r1074' /><a href='#f1074' class='c014'><sup>[1074]</sup></a> the vulgar, who understood nothing
of the cause, regarded the circumstance as a prodigy.<a id='r1075' /><a href='#f1075' class='c014'><sup>[1075]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From the knotted wood of the fir-tree, tablets for
painting or writing on were made, the inferior kinds
of which were very common; but there was a
superior and very beautiful sort used only by the
opulent.<a id='r1076' /><a href='#f1076' class='c014'><sup>[1076]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another piece of furniture in all Greek houses
was the chest or coffer<a id='r1077' /><a href='#f1077' class='c014'><sup>[1077]</sup></a> in which money and plate,
or costly garments, were deposited. Articles of this
description were frequently manufactured of the
finest and most aromatic woods, as cedar for example,
and adorned on all sides, as well as on the
cover, with numerous figures in relief, sometimes
in gold or ivory, as in the case of the celebrated
coffer of Cypselos preserved in the treasury at Olympia.<a id='r1078' /><a href='#f1078' class='c014'><sup>[1078]</sup></a>
Generally, however, they were made of humbler
materials; sometimes veneered with thin planks of
yew, which took a high polish. Persons of inferior
means substituted for these, mallequins of fine basket-work,
or plaited from the bark of cherry or
linden-tree.<a id='r1079' /><a href='#f1079' class='c014'><sup>[1079]</sup></a> We may here remark by the way,
that bread-baskets were manufactured from willows
and the twigs of chestnut-trees,<a id='r1080' /><a href='#f1080' class='c014'><sup>[1080]</sup></a> cleanly peeled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>and that in Egypt articles of this description were
generally woven or plaited from the leaves of the
date and doom-palm, and probably variegated in
colour as they are at present. At the court, however,
bread-baskets were at one period of gold, but
fashioned so as to resemble the rush-baskets in use
among the earlier Greeks.<a id='r1081' /><a href='#f1081' class='c014'><sup>[1081]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Lanterns, too, in the first instance, were of basketwork,<a id='r1082' /><a href='#f1082' class='c014'><sup>[1082]</sup></a>
though afterwards manufactured, as in modern
times, with thin plates of horn or ivory.<a id='r1083' /><a href='#f1083' class='c014'><sup>[1083]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In some parts of Greece when individuals, not
possessing costly furniture, desired to give a grand
entertainment, they hired whatever articles they stood
in need of, as seats, beds, vases, &amp;c., of a broker,
whose business, in the island of Samos, was once carried
on by the tyrant Polycrates.<a id='r1084' /><a href='#f1084' class='c014'><sup>[1084]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As ivory entered largely into the making of furniture
among the ancients,<a id='r1085' /><a href='#f1085' class='c014'><sup>[1085]</sup></a> the reader will not regret
to find here an explanation of the means by
which it was rendered soft and tractable. This secret
appears hitherto to have escaped the modern
writers on Art. Monsieur Dutens<a id='r1086' /><a href='#f1086' class='c014'><sup>[1086]</sup></a> and the Milanese
editors of Winkelmann<a id='r1087' /><a href='#f1087' class='c014'><sup>[1087]</sup></a> observe, that the ancients
possessed the art of softening ivory without, however,
giving any intimation that they understood in what
the secret consisted. But the whole matter was extremely
simple, since they merely steeped the piece
of ivory about to be worked in a fermented liquor,
called zythos,<a id='r1088' /><a href='#f1088' class='c014'><sup>[1088]</sup></a> prepared from barley, and drank commonly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>with or without a mixture of honey, by all
persons in Gaul. Many of these ivory ornaments
were produced by the turning-lathe. They turned
also from the knots of the Arcadian fir large bowls
of a shining black colour.<a id='r1089' /><a href='#f1089' class='c014'><sup>[1089]</sup></a> There was even a kind
of stone which, being soft when drawn from the
quarry, was turned and cut into bowls, plates, and
other articles for the table, which were susceptible
of a high polish, and became hard by constant exposure
to the air.<a id='r1090' /><a href='#f1090' class='c014'><sup>[1090]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was, probably, to the turner’s art that the
Greeks owed many of those straight and elegant
kinds of walkingsticks,<a id='r1091' /><a href='#f1091' class='c014'><sup>[1091]</sup></a> particularly affected by the
opulent, and called Persian, doubtless because the
use of them came originally from Asia. Others
preferred the Laconian scytale,<a id='r1092' /><a href='#f1092' class='c014'><sup>[1092]</sup></a> fashioned usually from
a piece of whitethorn, and philosophers, sticks of
olive-wood.<a id='r1093' /><a href='#f1093' class='c014'><sup>[1093]</sup></a> Rustics then, as now, were in the habit
of carrying twisted and uncouth walkingstaves, bent
sometimes atop, and of heavy materials. The straight
light stem of the malachè,<a id='r1094' /><a href='#f1094' class='c014'><sup>[1094]</sup></a> and birch, and elder,<a id='r1095' /><a href='#f1095' class='c014'><sup>[1095]</sup></a>
were likewise in use; while some carried sticks made
from the agnus castus or the laurel, which were believed
to possess the virtue of preserving those who
bore them from accident or injury.<a id='r1096' /><a href='#f1096' class='c014'><sup>[1096]</sup></a> The making of
umbrellas or parasols, which opened and closed like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>our own,<a id='r1097' /><a href='#f1097' class='c014'><sup>[1097]</sup></a> no doubt constituted a separate branch of
industry. These articles, it may be observed, were
manufactured with great elegance, with handles gracefully
ornamented, and furnished at the periphery<a id='r1098' /><a href='#f1098' class='c014'><sup>[1098]</sup></a> with
numerous elongated drops. It was, probably, the same
tradesmen in whose shops were found those folding-seats,
or camp-stools, invented by Dædalos, the use of
which seems to have been very common at Athens.<a id='r1099' /><a href='#f1099' class='c014'><sup>[1099]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting the manufacture of musical instruments,
we have but a few particulars to communicate, though
it formed a profitable branch of industry in every
part of Greece. Musical instruments were divided
by the ancients into three kinds:<a id='r1100' /><a href='#f1100' class='c014'><sup>[1100]</sup></a> those which were
played by means of the breath,—the pipe, the trumpet,
and the flute; those whose harmony resided in
their strings, as the lyre and the cithara; and those
which produced sound by beating or clashing against
each other, as cymbals and the drum. The best
trumpets, supposed to have been an invention of the
Tyrrhenians,<a id='r1101' /><a href='#f1101' class='c014'><sup>[1101]</sup></a> were obtained from Italy, though on
many occasions great sea-shells were substituted for
those larger instruments. In the East, trumpets were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>sometimes manufactured of cow-hide, though the
usual materials were brass and iron, with a little
bone for the mouth-piece.<a id='r1102' /><a href='#f1102' class='c014'><sup>[1102]</sup></a> There were two kinds,—the
straight and the crooked.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the pipe of barley-straw,<a id='r1103' /><a href='#f1103' class='c014'><sup>[1103]</sup></a> invented by Osiris,
nothing need be said except, that its use and manufacture
formed the amusement of shepherds. The
fashioning of the common pipe constituted an important
branch of industry, particularly in B&oelig;otia,
where the reed<a id='r1104' /><a href='#f1104' class='c014'><sup>[1104]</sup></a> from which it was made abounded
in the Orchomenian marshes,<a id='r1105' /><a href='#f1105' class='c014'><sup>[1105]</sup></a> between the Cephisos
and the Melas, in the place called Pelecania.<a id='r1106' /><a href='#f1106' class='c014'><sup>[1106]</sup></a> The
season for cutting, which prevailed up to the age
of Antigones, was the month Boedromion; but,
for the improvement of the instrument, that musician
altered the time, which thenceforward was in
the months Scirophorion and Hecatombion.<a id='r1107' /><a href='#f1107' class='c014'><sup>[1107]</sup></a> The
reeds were prepared in the following manner: being
cut, they were piled in a heap with their leaves on,
and left in the open air during the whole winter.
Having in spring been cleared of their outer integuments,
well rubbed and exposed to the sun, they
were, during the summer, cut into lengths at the
knots, and left a little longer in the open air.<a id='r1108' /><a href='#f1108' class='c014'><sup>[1108]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>internodial spaces did not fall short of two palms
in length, and the best portions of the reed used
for making the double pipe<a id='r1109' /><a href='#f1109' class='c014'><sup>[1109]</sup></a> was about the middle.<a id='r1110' /><a href='#f1110' class='c014'><sup>[1110]</sup></a>
Pipes and flutes<a id='r1111' /><a href='#f1111' class='c014'><sup>[1111]</sup></a> were likewise manufactured of the
leg-bones of stags, at least in B&oelig;otia. The lotos-wood<a id='r1112' /><a href='#f1112' class='c014'><sup>[1112]</sup></a>
transverse flute was an invention of the Africans.
The elym&oelig;an flute made of boxwood owed
its origin to the Phrygians, and was played during
the worship of Cybelè. That called hippophorbos
was invented by the last dwellers of Libya, who
habitually played on it while pasturing their great
droves of horses in the desert.<a id='r1113' /><a href='#f1113' class='c014'><sup>[1113]</sup></a> It appears to have
been a very simple instrument, fashioned of a piece
of laurel-wood, by removing the bark and scooping
out the pith. Its sharp shrill sound which could
be heard far and near, delighted the ears of the
horses, who probably, like the Turks, estimate the
merit of music by its loudness. The monaulos, a
favourite invention of the Egyptians, spoken of by
Sophocles in his Thamyris, was usually played in
marriage concerts.<a id='r1114' /><a href='#f1114' class='c014'><sup>[1114]</sup></a> The lugubrious funeral-pipe of
the Carians was a Phrygian invention. There existed
among the Thebans a curious instrument of
this kind, probably used in hunting, made from the
bones of fawns, with a coating of bronze.<a id='r1115' /><a href='#f1115' class='c014'><sup>[1115]</sup></a> The
Tyrrhenians, like the rude sportsmen of Europe,
drew music from the horn. Among the Ph&oelig;nicians
was a small flute made of goose-bones, not
exceeding a span in length, called gingras<a id='r1116' /><a href='#f1116' class='c014'><sup>[1116]</sup></a> in honour
of Adonis, so named in their language, which
emitting a plaintive and melancholy note, was doubtless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>much used in the wailing orgies of that divinity.
Its character being exceedingly simple, it was habitually
put into the hands of beginners,<a id='r1117' /><a href='#f1117' class='c014'><sup>[1117]</sup></a> and seems
to have been very common at Athens. The most
extraordinary pipes, however, enumerated by ancient
writers, were the ones in which those Scythian tribes
denominated by the Greeks, Cannibals, Black Cloaks,
and Arimaspians, delighted; and manufactured from
the leg-bones of eagles and vultures.<a id='r1118' /><a href='#f1118' class='c014'><sup>[1118]</sup></a> The Celts
and the islanders of the ocean, our own forefathers,
doubtless eschewed the music of vultures’ legs, and
contented themselves with the notes of the syrinx.<a id='r1119' /><a href='#f1119' class='c014'><sup>[1119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In earlier times there was a flute appropriated
to each mode, or grand division of the national
music, but afterwards Pronomos of Thebes,<a id='r1120' /><a href='#f1120' class='c014'><sup>[1120]</sup></a> invented
one equally well suited to every mode. Even
the manufacture of mouth-pieces, and flute-cases
formed a considerable branch of industry. The
materials from which the above instruments were
chiefly made, were, in addition to those already
mentioned, branches of the elder tree and dwarf
laurel, bones of asses and kids, ivory and silver.<a id='r1121' /><a href='#f1121' class='c014'><sup>[1121]</sup></a>
Organs, and hydraulic organs, the latter invented by
the Alexandrian barber Ctesibios, to whom antiquity
was likewise indebted for the knowledge of
the pump, were reckoned by the ancients among
wind-instruments.<a id='r1122' /><a href='#f1122' class='c014'><sup>[1122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of stringed-instruments the most common was the
lyre,<a id='r1123' /><a href='#f1123' class='c014'><sup>[1123]</sup></a> manufactured from many kinds of fine wood,
and sometimes of ivory.<a id='r1124' /><a href='#f1124' class='c014'><sup>[1124]</sup></a> The bridge was usually
of ilex.<a id='r1125' /><a href='#f1125' class='c014'><sup>[1125]</sup></a> The cithara,<a id='r1126' /><a href='#f1126' class='c014'><sup>[1126]</sup></a> introduced at Athens by
Phrynis,<a id='r1127' /><a href='#f1127' class='c014'><sup>[1127]</sup></a> was made sometimes of horn with wooden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>pegs,<a id='r1128' /><a href='#f1128' class='c014'><sup>[1128]</sup></a> though mention occurs of one formed entirely
of solid gold, adorned with figures in relief of the
Muses, Orpheus, and Apollo, and thickly studded
with emeralds and other precious stones.<a id='r1129' /><a href='#f1129' class='c014'><sup>[1129]</sup></a> The magadis,<a id='r1130' /><a href='#f1130' class='c014'><sup>[1130]</sup></a>
sometimes reckoned among wind-instruments,
was unquestionably stringed, since we find Timotheus,
accused at Sparta of innovating in the number of
its chords, pointing out to his accuser an ancient
statue of Apollo, in which the god was represented
playing on a magadis with an equal number.<a id='r1131' /><a href='#f1131' class='c014'><sup>[1131]</sup></a> In
proof of its antiquity it may be remarked, that Lesbothemis,
a sculptor, who flourished in a remote age
at Mytilene, where this instrument was always in
high favour,<a id='r1132' /><a href='#f1132' class='c014'><sup>[1132]</sup></a> represented one of the Muses with the
magadis in her hand. The pectis, said to have been
an invention of Sappho, and by some confounded
with the magadis, ought rather perhaps to be regarded
as a modification of that instrument.<a id='r1133' /><a href='#f1133' class='c014'><sup>[1133]</sup></a> The
epigoneion, so called from its inventor Epigonos, by
birth an Ambraciot, though afterwards made a citizen
of Sicyon, was a kind of harp with forty
strings, resembling, probably, those many-chorded
instruments represented on the monuments of Egypt
and Ethiopia. This Epigonos, is said to have been
the first person who in playing dispensed with the
use of the plectron.<a id='r1134' /><a href='#f1134' class='c014'><sup>[1134]</sup></a> The ancient Arabs forestalled
Signor Paganini, and drew a world of sweet sounds
from an instrument of one chord:<a id='r1135' /><a href='#f1135' class='c014'><sup>[1135]</sup></a> the Assyrians
had their pandoura, with three strings.<a id='r1136' /><a href='#f1136' class='c014'><sup>[1136]</sup></a> Among
the Scythians was found the pentachordon, stringed
with thongs of raw bull-hide, and played on by
a plectron of goat’s hoof. The Libyans, more especially
the Troglodytes, filled their caverns with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>music of the psithura, otherwise called the ascaron,
an instrument a cubit square, which produced sounds
resembling the tinkling of castanets. Cantharos attributes
its invention to the Thracians. To these
we may add the drum, the tambourine,<a id='r1137' /><a href='#f1137' class='c014'><sup>[1137]</sup></a> with
cymbals, and castanets, sometimes of brass, and
sometimes of shells, played on by women in honour
of Artemis.</p>

<p class='c001'>The business of the potter<a id='r1138' /><a href='#f1138' class='c014'><sup>[1138]</sup></a> was held in considerable
estimation among the Greeks, so that several
celebrated cities rivalled each other in their
productions. Among these, Athens,<a id='r1139' /><a href='#f1139' class='c014'><sup>[1139]</sup></a> Samos, and
Rhodes held the first rank.<a id='r1140' /><a href='#f1140' class='c014'><sup>[1140]</sup></a> Even the Bœotian Aulis
obtained some degree of reputation for its earthenware.<a id='r1141' /><a href='#f1141' class='c014'><sup>[1141]</sup></a>
But that made at Kolias,<a id='r1142' /><a href='#f1142' class='c014'><sup>[1142]</sup></a> in Attica,
from the clay there found, and richly painted with
figures in minium, appears to have been the most
beautiful known to antiquity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The number of rough articles produced was prodigious,
seeing that oil, and wine, and salt-fish,
and pickles, and a variety of other commodities
were exported in jars; while almost all culinary operations
were carried on in earthern vessels. Such
of these as found their way to Egypt, after the conquest
of that country by the Persians, were filled
with Nile water, and transported into the desert,
on camels, to slake the thirst of the wayfarers on
that arid waste.<a id='r1143' /><a href='#f1143' class='c014'><sup>[1143]</sup></a> Perhaps, the largest articles of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>earthenware, however, were the corn-jars, some of
which are said to have contained nearly a quarter
of grain, in lieu of which plaited corbels were sometimes
used.<a id='r1144' /><a href='#f1144' class='c014'><sup>[1144]</sup></a> Much art and elegance was displayed
in the forms, varnishing, and painting of fictile vases,
some of which, of light and graceful contour, were
made without bottoms, wholly for ornament.<a id='r1145' /><a href='#f1145' class='c014'><sup>[1145]</sup></a> The
colours employed in the painting of vases, more particularly
those intended to hold the ashes of the
dead, were generally light and durable; and the
ease and beauty of the figures prove that the ancient
potters paid great attention to the arts of design.
The ornaments were extremely various, sometimes
consisting of representations of the gods, as
Heracles, Pan, or the genii, sometimes of oakleaves,
garlands, or festoons, arranged with taste and elegance.<a id='r1146' /><a href='#f1146' class='c014'><sup>[1146]</sup></a>
Athenæus speaks of a kind of porcelain
called Rhossican,<a id='r1147' /><a href='#f1147' class='c014'><sup>[1147]</sup></a> covered with the forms of flowers,
upon which Cleopatra expended five minæ per day.
Another branch of the potter’s business consisted in
the manufacturing of lamps,<a id='r1148' /><a href='#f1148' class='c014'><sup>[1148]</sup></a> which were so generally
in use, that, throughout the Greek and the Roman
world, the sites of cities, the ruins of temples, and
the sepulchral chambers excavated beneath the earth,
lavishly abound with them, entire or in fragments.<a id='r1149' /><a href='#f1149' class='c014'><sup>[1149]</sup></a>
Hyperbolos is said to have amassed a considerable
fortune by selling lamps of an inferior quality.<a id='r1150' /><a href='#f1150' class='c014'><sup>[1150]</sup></a> Wax-candles,
however, were likewise in use, at least in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>later ages,<a id='r1151' /><a href='#f1151' class='c014'><sup>[1151]</sup></a> and with the same materials they fashioned
artificial pomegranates and other ornaments, together
with small portable images of animals, men, and gods,
which, like our figures of plaster of Paris, were sold,
as well as those of clay, about the streets. Some
notion, too, may be formed of the price, since we
find that a figure of Eros fetched a drachma.<a id='r1152' /><a href='#f1152' class='c014'><sup>[1152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The manufacture of glass<a id='r1153' /><a href='#f1153' class='c014'><sup>[1153]</sup></a> was carried to a very
high degree of perfection among the ancients.<a id='r1154' /><a href='#f1154' class='c014'><sup>[1154]</sup></a> They
understood the methods of blowing, cutting, and
engraving on it; could stain it of every rich and
brilliant colour so as to imitate the most precious
gems,<a id='r1155' /><a href='#f1155' class='c014'><sup>[1155]</sup></a> from the ruby and the amethyst to the turquoise
and the beryl; they could fashion it into jars,
and bowls, and vases, exhibiting all the various hues
of the peacock’s train, which, like shot-silks and the
breast of the dove, exhibited fresh tints in every
different light,—fading, quivering, and melting into
each other as the eye changed its point of view.<a id='r1156' /><a href='#f1156' class='c014'><sup>[1156]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Squares of glass were produced, perfectly polished
and transparent without, but containing figures of
various colours in their interior.<a id='r1157' /><a href='#f1157' class='c014'><sup>[1157]</sup></a> Glass, likewise,
was wrought into bassi and alti rilievi, and cast, as
gems were cut, into cameos.<a id='r1158' /><a href='#f1158' class='c014'><sup>[1158]</sup></a> The manufacturers of
Alexandria excelled in the working of glass,<a id='r1159' /><a href='#f1159' class='c014'><sup>[1159]</sup></a> with
which they skilfully imitated all kinds of earthenware,
fabricating cups of every known form.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is added, moreover, that a certain kind of earth
was found in Egypt, without which the best kind
of coloured glass<a id='r1160' /><a href='#f1160' class='c014'><sup>[1160]</sup></a> could not be produced. Petronius
informs us, that, in the reign of Tiberius, a
skilful experimentalist discovered the art of rendering
this substance malleable, but that the emperor,
from some freak of tyranny, put the man to death,
and thus his secret was lost to the world.<a id='r1161' /><a href='#f1161' class='c014'><sup>[1161]</sup></a> A similar
act of cruelty was perpetrated by the public
authorities at Dantzic, who, in the seventeenth century,
caused an able mechanician, who had invented
a superior kind of ribbon-loom, to be strangled.<a id='r1162' /><a href='#f1162' class='c014'><sup>[1162]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 id='ch6.6' class='c012'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> INDUSTRY: OIL AND COLOUR MEN.—ITALIAN WAREHOUSES.—DRUGGISTS.—COLLECTORS OF SIMPLES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There was, moreover, produced in Greece, a
number of articles, whether of use or luxury, to
the venders of which it appears difficult to appropriate
a name. It must necessarily be inferred,
however, that there existed a class of shopkeepers
analogous to our oil and colour men, at whose establishments
were found most or all of the following
commodities: every kind of vegetable oil, for cookery,
painting, or to be burned as lamp-oil, of sea
salt, probably for medicinal purposes,<a id='r1163' /><a href='#f1163' class='c014'><sup>[1163]</sup></a> oil of horseradish,<a id='r1164' /><a href='#f1164' class='c014'><sup>[1164]</sup></a>
used instead of the root itself, as a condiment.
Among the lamp-oils it is worthy of observation
that the Greeks included castor oil<a id='r1165' /><a href='#f1165' class='c014'><sup>[1165]</sup></a> which
was commonly, from its nauseous effects, eschewed
as a medicine. Bitumen<a id='r1166' /><a href='#f1166' class='c014'><sup>[1166]</sup></a> also was occasionally
burnt in lamps. Their lampwicks were ordinarily
of rushes,<a id='r1167' /><a href='#f1167' class='c014'><sup>[1167]</sup></a> which they sometimes anointed with the
oil expressed from the seeds of the myagrum perenne;<a id='r1168' /><a href='#f1168' class='c014'><sup>[1168]</sup></a>
and from certain nuts found on the oak
they obtained a sort of woolly substance<a id='r1169' /><a href='#f1169' class='c014'><sup>[1169]</sup></a> which, being
twisted into wicks, burnt freely without oil.
The dried stem of the torch-weed<a id='r1170' /><a href='#f1170' class='c014'><sup>[1170]</sup></a> was likewise employed
for this purpose. Their flambeaux consisted
originally of slips of the pine or pitch tree,<a id='r1171' /><a href='#f1171' class='c014'><sup>[1171]</sup></a> or even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>as at Rhodes of the bark of the vine,<a id='r1172' /><a href='#f1172' class='c014'><sup>[1172]</sup></a> but afterwards
certain combustible compositions were burned in
painted and ornamented handles.<a id='r1173' /><a href='#f1173' class='c014'><sup>[1173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The making of pitch, generally found in these
shops, was carried on in the following manner,<a id='r1174' /><a href='#f1174' class='c014'><sup>[1174]</sup></a>
particularly among the Macedonians: Having cleared
a large level space in the forests, as when constructing
a threshing-floor, they carefully paved it, and
gave the whole a slope towards the centre. The
billets of wood were then piled up endways as
close to each other as possible, and so as that the
height of the heap should always be in proportion
to its magnitude. These piles were frequently of
enormous dimensions, falling little short of a hundred
yards in circumference and rising to the height
of eighty or ninety feet. The whole mound was
then covered with turf and earth; and the wood
having been set on fire by means of an open passage
below, which immediately afterwards was closed,
numerous ladders were thrown up along its sides in
order that, should the least smoke anywhere appear,
fresh layers of turf and earth might be cast upon it:
for if the flame found a vent the hopes of the manufacturer
were destroyed. The pitch flowed off by
an underground channel leading from the centre
of the area to a spacious cistern sunk in the earth
about twenty feet beyond the circumference of the
mound, where it was suffered to cool. During two
days and two nights the fire in these heaps continued
generally to burn, requiring the incessant
care and vigilance of the workmen, though it frequently
happened that before sunset on the second
day, the earthy crust flattened and fell in, the wood
being reduced to ashes. This was generally preceded
by the pitch ceasing to flow. The whole of this
period was converted into a holiday by the labourers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>who offered sacrifice to the gods, and preferred
many prayers, that their pitch might be plentiful
and good.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nitre was procured from wood-ashes,<a id='r1175' /><a href='#f1175' class='c014'><sup>[1175]</sup></a> as it is at this
day in Circassia, from the ashes of a plant cultivated
for the purpose. It has been supposed that the
ancients were acquainted with gunpowder;<a id='r1176' /><a href='#f1176' class='c014'><sup>[1176]</sup></a> and there
appears to have been a dim tradition of artificial thunder
and lightning among the Brachmanes in the
remotest antiquity.<a id='r1177' /><a href='#f1177' class='c014'><sup>[1177]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The demand for the various earths and colours
was considerable; such as the Melian, a fine white
marl, used by artists frequently for communicating
to green paint a pale hue;<a id='r1178' /><a href='#f1178' class='c014'><sup>[1178]</sup></a> the Cimolian, by fullers;<a id='r1179' /><a href='#f1179' class='c014'><sup>[1179]</sup></a>
and the gypsum, employed occasionally by both.
The Samian, being fat and unctuous,<a id='r1180' /><a href='#f1180' class='c014'><sup>[1180]</sup></a> was eschewed
by painters, though it found its place among the
materia medica. Another article in much request
was the argol, a beautiful moss,<a id='r1181' /><a href='#f1181' class='c014'><sup>[1181]</sup></a> used both by painters
and dyers; to which we may add the cinnabar<a id='r1182' /><a href='#f1182' class='c014'><sup>[1182]</sup></a> and
the kermes, used for dying scarlet; the Indian
black,<a id='r1183' /><a href='#f1183' class='c014'><sup>[1183]</sup></a> indigo, ultramarine, lamp and ivory black,
painter’s soot, collected from glass furnaces,<a id='r1184' /><a href='#f1184' class='c014'><sup>[1184]</sup></a> verdigris,
ceruse, and minium, used in painting vases and
clay statues.<a id='r1185' /><a href='#f1185' class='c014'><sup>[1185]</sup></a> Other substances which sometimes
entered into the materials of painters were, the sandarach<a id='r1186' /><a href='#f1186' class='c014'><sup>[1186]</sup></a>
and the orpiment, found in gold, silver, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>copper mines, ochre, ruddle, and chrysocolla. Ruddle
was successfully imitated by burnt ochre, the manufacturing
of which was the invention of Cydias,<a id='r1187' /><a href='#f1187' class='c014'><sup>[1187]</sup></a>
who having observed that a quantity of ochre found
in a house which was burnt down had assumed a
red colour, profited by the hint, though the article
thus produced was inferior to the natural. The
Lemnian earth,<a id='r1188' /><a href='#f1188' class='c014'><sup>[1188]</sup></a> having been mixed with goats’ blood,
kneaded into small round pastilles, and stamped with
the figure of a goat, was vended, partly as a medicine,
partly to be used in sacrifice. In the same
shops, doubtless, sealing-wax and ink were sold.<a id='r1189' /><a href='#f1189' class='c014'><sup>[1189]</sup></a>
The receipt for preparing the latter was as follows:<a id='r1190' /><a href='#f1190' class='c014'><sup>[1190]</sup></a>
to an ounce of gum they added three ounces of
pine-torch or resin soot, or even that which was
obtained from the glass furnaces, and used, as above
observed, by painters. In this latter case, a mina
of soot was mingled with a pound and a half of
gum, and an ounce and a half of bull’s glue and
copperas-water. An infusion of wormwood<a id='r1191' /><a href='#f1191' class='c014'><sup>[1191]</sup></a> was
sometimes used in the manufacture of ink, which
preserved the manuscripts written with it from being
gnawed by rats or other vermin. Another method
was, to smear the parchment with saffron and cedar
oil.<a id='r1192' /><a href='#f1192' class='c014'><sup>[1192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Next to these, perhaps, should be ranged those
shops which resembled our Italian warehouses, where
the gourmands of antiquity procured their best vinegar,
pickles, and sauces.<a id='r1193' /><a href='#f1193' class='c014'><sup>[1193]</sup></a> To enumerate all the
articles found in such an establishment would be
somewhat difficult; but we may observe that they sold,
among other things, the best Colophonian mustard,<a id='r1194' /><a href='#f1194' class='c014'><sup>[1194]</sup></a>
pepper,<a id='r1195' /><a href='#f1195' class='c014'><sup>[1195]</sup></a> together with all the substitutes occasionally
used for it, such as the Syrian nard,<a id='r1196' /><a href='#f1196' class='c014'><sup>[1196]</sup></a> water-pepper,<a id='r1197' /><a href='#f1197' class='c014'><sup>[1197]</sup></a>
and, among the ancient Italians, lovage of
Lombardy,<a id='r1198' /><a href='#f1198' class='c014'><sup>[1198]</sup></a> garlic heads,<a id='r1199' /><a href='#f1199' class='c014'><sup>[1199]</sup></a> a mixture of salt and
thyme,<a id='r1200' /><a href='#f1200' class='c014'><sup>[1200]</sup></a> pickled olives, and cornel-berries, to be eaten
at table, pickled dittander,<a id='r1201' /><a href='#f1201' class='c014'><sup>[1201]</sup></a> mountain rue,<a id='r1202' /><a href='#f1202' class='c014'><sup>[1202]</sup></a> snakeweed
or wake-robin, fennel or chervil, tendrils of
the wild vine,<a id='r1203' /><a href='#f1203' class='c014'><sup>[1203]</sup></a> eringo root, sea-heath, cammock, lettuces
and parsley.<a id='r1204' /><a href='#f1204' class='c014'><sup>[1204]</sup></a> To these may be added silphion,
sesame, citron-peel, cumin, wild marjoram, capers,
cresses, and fig-leaves.<a id='r1205' /><a href='#f1205' class='c014'><sup>[1205]</sup></a> Among the Syrians, the root
and seeds of the sison-amomum were used as spices,
and pickled with sliced gourds.<a id='r1206' /><a href='#f1206' class='c014'><sup>[1206]</sup></a> The Arabs, we are
told, seasoned their dishes with the leaf of the ginger
plant.<a id='r1207' /><a href='#f1207' class='c014'><sup>[1207]</sup></a> Ginger-root was likewise known and used
as a condiment in Greece.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although, properly speaking, there may, in early
times, have been no such trades as those of the
druggist and the apothecary, there very soon arose
a class of men who nearly resembled them, though
professing to practise medicine.<a id='r1208' /><a href='#f1208' class='c014'><sup>[1208]</sup></a> Into the shops of
those persons we shall now beg leave to enter, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>observe some few of the materials with which the
children of Æsculapius preserved or destroyed the
health of the Greeks. The art of medicine itself,
as it existed among them, I shall not venture to
examine, abandoning that part of the subject to the
investigation of professional men.<a id='r1209' /><a href='#f1209' class='c014'><sup>[1209]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The interior of an ancient surgery, though it may
have been less lavishly furnished than one of our
own day, made, nevertheless, some pretensions to
show. There were, for example, ranged in order on
shelves, numerous medicine chests of ivory; brass
and silver cupping instruments,<a id='r1210' /><a href='#f1210' class='c014'><sup>[1210]</sup></a> lancet-cases, and
cases inlaid with gold.<a id='r1211' /><a href='#f1211' class='c014'><sup>[1211]</sup></a> Flowers and aromatic plants
were laid up in boxes of the wood of the linden tree,
while seeds were preserved in paper or leaves. Liquid
medicines were kept in vessels of silver, glass,
or horn, or even in earthenware jars, provided they
were well glazed. For these they sometimes substituted
vases of boxwood, though those of metal
were generally preferred, at least for all such as were
intended for the eyes, or contained vinegar, pitch,
or cedar juice. Lard, marrow, and all similar substances,
were put into vessels of pewter.<a id='r1212' /><a href='#f1212' class='c014'><sup>[1212]</sup></a> The instruments<a id='r1213' /><a href='#f1213' class='c014'><sup>[1213]</sup></a>
in most common use besides the bistoury,
were the forceps, the scissors, the hypographs, the
ear-pick, the probe,<a id='r1214' /><a href='#f1214' class='c014'><sup>[1214]</sup></a> the needle, the scalpel, the
tooth-file, the tooth-wrench, the eueidion, and the
podostrabe, an instrument for reducing luxations.
We ought, likewise, perhaps, to mention the bandages,
ligatures, swathes, plaisters, lint, amulets, and
bleeding-bowls.<a id='r1215' /><a href='#f1215' class='c014'><sup>[1215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Their <a id='corr203.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='knowlege'>knowledge</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_203.1'><ins class='correction' title='knowlege'>knowledge</ins></a></span> of the materia medica was acquired
for the most part by experience, though there
existed, previously to the time of Hippocrates, works
on the virtues of plants, among which we may mention
that of Cratevas. By degrees these treatises were
greatly multiplied, and included, at length, a species
of encyclopedia, arranged in alphabetical order;<a id='r1216' /><a href='#f1216' class='c014'><sup>[1216]</sup></a>
though not one single fragment of it has been spared
by time. At first, and for many ages, the art relied
chiefly upon simples, the qualities of which were
consequently studied with great ardour, and, no doubt,
with much success. Numerous individuals devoted
themselves to the gathering, drying, and preserving,
of medicinal roots and herbs, an occupation requiring
considerable time and labour,—for which reasons
the physicians, by whom it was originally performed,
soon abandoned it to the rizotomists.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the business of collecting simples, by whomsoever
performed, required great knowledge and perseverance.
The individuals who carried it on spread
themselves, at the proper seasons of the year, through
all Greece, more especially over Mount Pelion in Thessaly,
Telethra in Eubœa, Parnassos in Phocis, and the
uplands of Laconia and Arcadia,<a id='r1217' /><a href='#f1217' class='c014'><sup>[1217]</sup></a> making inquiries,
as they went along, of the inhabitants of every district
and canton respecting the medicaments in use
among them, and collecting from the mouths of
peasants and shepherds the fruits of their limited
but close observation. They passed, as a matter
of course, the greater part of their lives in the fields,
studying the topography and distribution of plants,
and investigating all the phenomena of vegetation.
They believed, that herbs vary in virtues and powers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>according as they are found in mountains or in valleys,
in places overrun with moisture, and where
the air is rank and heavy, or on spots swelling and
exposed, where they are fanned and invigorated by
every breeze that blows. They laid much stress, too,
on the season of the year, on the weather, and on the
hour of the day; some simples requiring, it was supposed,
to be gathered when the sun has exhaled
from them all extraneous moisture, others before its
rising, others amid the darkness of night when their
leaves and flowers were suffused with dew. They
were guided, likewise, in their operations by other
rules, some founded on experience, others originating
in fancy and superstition. In culling, for example,
the thapsia<a id='r1218' /><a href='#f1218' class='c014'><sup>[1218]</sup></a> and several other herbs, they were careful,
having first anointed themselves with oil, to
stand with their backs to the wind, persuaded that
they otherwise should inhale certain noxious effluvia
which would cause their whole bodies to swell, or,
in the case of the dog-rose,<a id='r1219' /><a href='#f1219' class='c014'><sup>[1219]</sup></a> that their sight would
be impaired.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those who gathered the mountain rue,<a id='r1220' /><a href='#f1220' class='c014'><sup>[1220]</sup></a> anointed
their faces and hands with oil, to guard themselves
against cutaneous inflammation. Again, of other
herbs the juices are so pungent as to burn like
fire: these were collected in the greatest haste.
In digging the hellebore,<a id='r1221' /><a href='#f1221' class='c014'><sup>[1221]</sup></a> too, the odour of which
was supposed rapidly to affect the brain, they proceeded
with great celerity, and were careful to eat
a clove or two of garlic beforehand, and to drink
a little pure wine after. But all these precautions
were trifling compared with those which the good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>rizotomists had persuaded themselves were indispensable
in collecting the peony flower.<a id='r1222' /><a href='#f1222' class='c014'><sup>[1222]</sup></a> About this
operation they interwove a sort of netting of romance:
it was to be undertaken they affirmed by
night, lest the woodpeckers, who regarded it with
as much jealousy as the Indian ants do their gold,
should fall upon the unfortunate herbalists, and with
their sharp beaks pluck out their eyes. So, likewise,
in gathering the centaury they were to stand
on their guard lest they should be assaulted and
maltreated by the hawks. Considering all these
numerous evils which rizotomist flesh was heir to,
Theophrastus thinks it by no means absurd, that
when issuing forth on an enterprise so perilous, they
should have fortified their nerves with many prayers.
Some few, however, of their practices the philosopher
condemns as a trifle beyond the mark, as for
example when in digging the root of the Asclepian
all-heal, they judged it necessary to propitiate
mother earth by burying in its stead a cake composed
of many various sweets. And again in unearthing
the root of the iris f&oelig;tidissima, they interred
a cake of spring wheat mixed with honey,
not, however, before they had drawn round the spot
a treble circle with a two-edged sword. When they
had obtained possession of one of the roots, they
held it up for some time in the air, and then proceeded
to procure a second, and so on. Strangest
of all, however, were the ceremonies observed in
digging the mandrake.<a id='r1223' /><a href='#f1223' class='c014'><sup>[1223]</sup></a> First, the triple magic circle
was inscribed on the earth with a sword, then
the pious rizotomist turned his face toward the
west, and began to use his knife, while a second
operator went dancing round, uttering all kinds of
amorous incantations. Still more perilous was the
gathering of the black hellebore, which they performed
with the face towards the east, and many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>prayers to Apollo and Asclepios.<a id='r1224' /><a href='#f1224' class='c014'><sup>[1224]</sup></a> The strictest
watch was meanwhile to be kept, that no eagle
appeared above the horizon; for if the eye of this
king of birds happened to fall upon the herbalist
while engaged in digging, he would infallibly die
within the year.<a id='r1225' /><a href='#f1225' class='c014'><sup>[1225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>After all these toilsome and dangerous enterprises
it was natural that the rizotomists should desire to
enjoy some advantages,<a id='r1226' /><a href='#f1226' class='c014'><sup>[1226]</sup></a> which, accordingly, they
procured themselves by selling dear their hard-won
prizes to their equally superstitious countrymen.
Making no pretension as I have said to describe
the regular medical practice among the Greeks, I
shall here, nevertheless, introduce some few particulars
more or less connected with it, which may
be regarded as characteristic of the age and people.<a id='r1227' /><a href='#f1227' class='c014'><sup>[1227]</sup></a>
Great were the virtues which they ascribed to the
herb alysson, (biscutella didyma,) which, being pounded
and eaten with meat, cured hydrophobia. Nay,
more, being suspended in a house, it promoted the
health of its inhabitants;<a id='r1228' /><a href='#f1228' class='c014'><sup>[1228]</sup></a> it protected likewise both
man and cattle from enchantment; and, bound in
a piece of scarlet flannel round the necks of the
latter, it preserved them from all diseases.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coriander-seed,<a id='r1229' /><a href='#f1229' class='c014'><sup>[1229]</sup></a> eaten in too great quantity, produced,
they thought, a derangement of the intellect.
Ointment of saffron had an opposite effect, for the
nostrils and heads of lunatics being rubbed therewith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>they were supposed to receive considerable relief.<a id='r1230' /><a href='#f1230' class='c014'><sup>[1230]</sup></a>
Melampos the goatherd was reported to have
cured the daughters of Prætos<a id='r1231' /><a href='#f1231' class='c014'><sup>[1231]</sup></a> of their madness
by large doses of black hellebore, which thereafter
received from him the name of Melampodion. Sea-onions<a id='r1232' /><a href='#f1232' class='c014'><sup>[1232]</sup></a>
suspended over the doors preserved from enchantment,
as did likewise a branch of rhamnus over
doors or windows.<a id='r1233' /><a href='#f1233' class='c014'><sup>[1233]</sup></a> A decoction of rosemary<a id='r1234' /><a href='#f1234' class='c014'><sup>[1234]</sup></a> and of
the leaves and stem of the anemone<a id='r1235' /><a href='#f1235' class='c014'><sup>[1235]</sup></a> was administered
to nurses to promote the secretion of milk, and
a like potion prepared from the leaves of the Cretan
dittany<a id='r1236' /><a href='#f1236' class='c014'><sup>[1236]</sup></a> was given to women in labour. This herb,
in order to preserve its virtues unimpaired, and that
it might be the more easily transported to all parts
of the country, was preserved in a joint of a ferula
or reed. A plaster of incense,<a id='r1237' /><a href='#f1237' class='c014'><sup>[1237]</sup></a> Cimolian earth,
and oil of roses, was applied to reduce the swelling
of the breasts. A medicine prepared from mule’s
fern,<a id='r1238' /><a href='#f1238' class='c014'><sup>[1238]</sup></a> was believed to produce sterility, as were likewise
the waters of a certain fountain near Pyrrha,
while to those about Thespiæ a contrary effect
was attributed, as well as to the wine of Heraclea
in Arcadia.<a id='r1239' /><a href='#f1239' class='c014'><sup>[1239]</sup></a> The inhabitants of this primitive region
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>drank milk as an aperient<a id='r1240' /><a href='#f1240' class='c014'><sup>[1240]</sup></a> in the spring, because of
the medicinal herbs on which the cattle were then
supposed to feed. Medicines of laxative properties
were prepared from the juice of the wild cucumber,
which were said to retain their virtues for two hundred
years,<a id='r1241' /><a href='#f1241' class='c014'><sup>[1241]</sup></a> though simples in general were thought
to lose their medicinal qualities in less than four.<a id='r1242' /><a href='#f1242' class='c014'><sup>[1242]</sup></a>
The oriental gum called kankamon was administered
in water or honeyed vinegar to fat persons
to diminish their obesity, and also as a remedy for
the toothache.<a id='r1243' /><a href='#f1243' class='c014'><sup>[1243]</sup></a> For this latter purpose the gum
of the Ethiopian olive<a id='r1244' /><a href='#f1244' class='c014'><sup>[1244]</sup></a> was put into the hollow
tooth, though more efficacy perhaps was attributed
to the root of dittander<a id='r1245' /><a href='#f1245' class='c014'><sup>[1245]</sup></a> which they suspended as
a charm about the neck. A plaster of the root
of the white thorn<a id='r1246' /><a href='#f1246' class='c014'><sup>[1246]</sup></a> or iris<a id='r1247' /><a href='#f1247' class='c014'><sup>[1247]</sup></a> roots prepared with
flour of copper, honey, and great centaury, drew out
thorns and arrowheads without pain. An unguent
procured from fern<a id='r1248' /><a href='#f1248' class='c014'><sup>[1248]</sup></a> was sold to rustics for curing
the necks of their cattle galled by the yoke. A
decoction of marsh-mallow leaves<a id='r1249' /><a href='#f1249' class='c014'><sup>[1249]</sup></a> and wine or honeyed
vinegar was administered to persons who had
been stung by bees or wasps or other insects;<a id='r1250' /><a href='#f1250' class='c014'><sup>[1250]</sup></a>
bites and burns were healed by an external application
of the leaf smeared with oil, and the powdered
roots cast into water caused it to freeze if
placed out during the night in the open air; an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>unguent was prepared with oil from reeds, green
or dry, which protected those who anointed themselves
with it, from the stings of venomous reptiles.
Cinnamon unguent,<a id='r1251' /><a href='#f1251' class='c014'><sup>[1251]</sup></a> or terebinth and myrtle-berries,<a id='r1252' /><a href='#f1252' class='c014'><sup>[1252]</sup></a>
boiled in wine, were supposed to be a preservative
against the bite of the tarantula or scorpion,
as was the pistachio nut against that of serpents.<a id='r1253' /><a href='#f1253' class='c014'><sup>[1253]</sup></a>
Some persons ate a roasted scorpion to cure its
own bite;<a id='r1254' /><a href='#f1254' class='c014'><sup>[1254]</sup></a> a powder, moreover, was prepared from
sea-crabs supposed to be fatal to this reptile.<a id='r1255' /><a href='#f1255' class='c014'><sup>[1255]</sup></a> Vipers<a id='r1256' /><a href='#f1256' class='c014'><sup>[1256]</sup></a>
were made to contribute their part to the
materia medica; for, being caught alive, they were
enclosed with salt and dried figs in a vase which
was then put into a furnace till its contents were
reduced to charcoal, which they esteemed a valuable
medicine. A considerable quantity of viper’s
flesh was in the last century imported from Egypt
into Venice, to be used in the composition of medicinal
treacle.<a id='r1257' /><a href='#f1257' class='c014'><sup>[1257]</sup></a> From the flowers of the sneezewort,<a id='r1258' /><a href='#f1258' class='c014'><sup>[1258]</sup></a>
a sort of snuff appears to have been manufactured,
though probably used only in medicines.
The ashes of old leather<a id='r1259' /><a href='#f1259' class='c014'><sup>[1259]</sup></a> cured burns, galls, and
blistered feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>The common remedy when persons had eaten poisonous
mushrooms was a dose of nitre exhibited in
vinegar and water;<a id='r1260' /><a href='#f1260' class='c014'><sup>[1260]</sup></a> with water it was esteemed a
cure for the sting of the burncow, and with benzoin
it operated as an antidote against the poison of bulls’
blood. The seeds of mountain-rue, in small quantities,
were regarded as an antidote, but, administered
too copiously, were themselves lethal.<a id='r1261' /><a href='#f1261' class='c014'><sup>[1261]</sup></a> White
hellebore was employed with honey and other medicines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>to poison rats;<a id='r1262' /><a href='#f1262' class='c014'><sup>[1262]</sup></a> bastard saffron,<a id='r1263' /><a href='#f1263' class='c014'><sup>[1263]</sup></a> mice, pigs,
and dogs; which last were physicked with hellebore.<a id='r1264' /><a href='#f1264' class='c014'><sup>[1264]</sup></a>
The deadly qualities of this plant, when taken in any
quantity, were universally known, and, therefore,
the pharmacopolist, Thrasyas,<a id='r1265' /><a href='#f1265' class='c014'><sup>[1265]</sup></a> of Mantinea, who
boasted of having invented a poison which would
kill without pain, attained the credit of possessing
something like miraculous powers, because he used
frequently, in the presence of many witnesses to
eat a whole root, or even two, of hellebore. One
day, however, a shepherd, coming into his shop, utterly
destroyed his reputation; for, in the sight of
all present, he devoured a whole handful, observing
that it was nothing at all, for that he and his
brethren on the mountains were accustomed to do
as much, and more, daily.<a id='r1266' /><a href='#f1266' class='c014'><sup>[1266]</sup></a> They had, in fact, discovered,
that medicine is no medicine, and poison
no poison, to those with whose bodies they have
been assimilated by use. When limbs were to be
amputated, and previous to the application of the
cautery, a dose of powdered mandragora-root was
usually administered.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the nature, power, and uses, of ancient poisons,
it is not my purpose to enlarge.<a id='r1267' /><a href='#f1267' class='c014'><sup>[1267]</sup></a> It may be proper,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>however, to observe, that they had discovered drugs
which would kill secretly, and at almost any given time
from the moment of administering them. They, by
certain preparations of aconite,<a id='r1268' /><a href='#f1268' class='c014'><sup>[1268]</sup></a> so called from Aconè,
a village in the country of the Mariandynians, the
professional poisoners could take off an individual
at any fixed period, from two months to two years.
The possession, however, of this poison was in itself
a capital offence.<a id='r1269' /><a href='#f1269' class='c014'><sup>[1269]</sup></a> It was usually administered in
wine or hydromel, where its presence was not to
be detected by the taste. At first, there was supposed
to exist no remedy, so that all who took it
inevitably perished; but, at length, physicians, and
even the common people of the country, discovered
more than one antidote prepared from the ground-pine,<a id='r1270' /><a href='#f1270' class='c014'><sup>[1270]</sup></a>
from honey, and from the juice of the grape.
Another poison, evidently in frequent use, was the
bulb of the meadow-saffron (colchicum autumnale),
which being known to everybody, and nearly always
at hand, slaves<a id='r1271' /><a href='#f1271' class='c014'><sup>[1271]</sup></a> were said to have plucked and eaten
when enraged against their masters; but, repenting
presently, they used, with still greater celerity, to
rush in search of an antidote. Some persons, anxious
to fortify their children against the effects of
all noxious drugs, were in the habit of administering
to them as soon as born a small dose of the powder
of bindweed,<a id='r1272' /><a href='#f1272' class='c014'><sup>[1272]</sup></a> which they believed to possess the
power of protecting them for ever. When persons
were invited out to dine where they ran the risk of
meeting with ratsbane in their dishes, it was customary
to chew a little calamint before the repast.<a id='r1273' /><a href='#f1273' class='c014'><sup>[1273]</sup></a>
In the case of the canine species the Argives, instead
of having recourse to poison, like their neighbours,
used to celebrate an annual festival during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>the dog-days, in which they seem to have slaughtered<a id='r1274' /><a href='#f1274' class='c014'><sup>[1274]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>the moist atmosphere of their city having been peculiarly
liable to engender hydrophobia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the more remarkable of the materia medica
was the cedar gum, generally transparent, and of a
most pungent odour. It was esteemed destructive
of living bodies, but formed, doubtless, an important
ingredient among the embalmer’s materials, since it
completely preserved corpses from corruption, on
which account it was sometimes called the Life of
the Dead.<a id='r1275' /><a href='#f1275' class='c014'><sup>[1275]</sup></a> It entered, moreover, into preparation
designed to sharpen the sight.</p>

<p class='c001'>The gum obtained from the cherry-tree<a id='r1276' /><a href='#f1276' class='c014'><sup>[1276]</sup></a> was administered
in wine and water to promote appetite.
A dose of saffron and boiled wine restored the tone
of the stomach after excess at table. Asses’ milk
was habitually given to consumptive patients, connected
with which practice there is an apothegm
of Demosthenes, which may be worth repeating.
When he was once exerting himself to prevail on
some foreign state to ally itself with Athens, an
orator in opposition observed, that the Athenians
were like asses’ milk, whose presence always indicated
sickness in the places they visited. “It is
true,” replied Demosthenes, “but the sickness
previously exists, and they come to cure it.” A
mixture of salt and water, to which the Egyptians
added the juice of the radish,<a id='r1277' /><a href='#f1277' class='c014'><sup>[1277]</sup></a> constituted a very
common emetic. Opium was in general use even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>so early, apparently, as the age of Homer,<a id='r1278' /><a href='#f1278' class='c014'><sup>[1278]</sup></a> who

The Spartan soldiers appear to have made
considerable use of the poppy-head;<a id='r1279' /><a href='#f1279' class='c014'><sup>[1279]</sup></a> but whether
for the same purpose as the Rajpoots of modern
India, I do not pretend to determine. Persons desirous
of obtaining frightful and dismal dreams<a id='r1280' /><a href='#f1280' class='c014'><sup>[1280]</sup></a>
could always gratify their wishes by eating leaks
or lentils, or the seeds of the great bind-weed,<a id='r1281' /><a href='#f1281' class='c014'><sup>[1281]</sup></a>
mixed with dorycnion. We may mention by the
way, that the ancients understood well the doctrine
of the circulation of the blood.<a id='r1282' /><a href='#f1282' class='c014'><sup>[1282]</sup></a></p>

the naturalist to mean that
citron-leaves were folded in
the manuscript: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quorum hæc

Cf. Plin. Nat. Hist. xii.

into Greece or Italy until
several centuries after the age
of Numa, it is very clear that
“cedratos” must remain in the
text of Pliny.</p>

From a passage in Herodotus
there seems reason to suspect,
that certain Asiatic nations were
already in his time acquainted
with the inebriating effects of
opium smoke. For, describing
the inhabitants of the larger
islands found in the Araxes, he
relates that they were accustomed
to gather together round a
fire, and casting the fruit of some
unknown tree into the flames to
inhale with delight the smoke
and effluvia emitted by it, until
they experienced all the delight
and madness of intoxication,
which impelled them to leap
about, and dance and sing. i.

<p class='c013'>In spinning and weaving the ancients evidently
rivalled us, though without the aid of machinery.
As far, indeed, as the former process is concerned,
no machinery can rival the human hand, which,
from its slight oily exudation<a id='r1283' /><a href='#f1283' class='c014'><sup>[1283]</sup></a> is enabled to communicate
superior strength and evenness to the
finest threads. Thus in Hindustân muslins were
formerly produced, which, laid on the grass and
wetted by dew, became invisible.<a id='r1284' /><a href='#f1284' class='c014'><sup>[1284]</sup></a> And there is no
reason for doubting that the produce of ancient
Greek looms rivalled those of Dakka. The fabrics
of Cos<a id='r1285' /><a href='#f1285' class='c014'><sup>[1285]</sup></a> and Tarentum appear, in fact, from the
testimony of the ancients, to have floated like a
snowy mist around the female form, disclosing its
whole contour like a gauze veil.<a id='r1286' /><a href='#f1286' class='c014'><sup>[1286]</sup></a> In flowered and
variegated tissues,<a id='r1287' /><a href='#f1287' class='c014'><sup>[1287]</sup></a> too, they attained extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>excellence. The finest and most brilliant shot stuffs
imitating the breast of the dove, flowered cloth of
gold, and the weaving of gold wire itself, were
known to the ancients. Silk, before that of China<a id='r1288' /><a href='#f1288' class='c014'><sup>[1288]</sup></a>
was common in the west, they obtained from the
beard of a sea shell; and lawn and cambric and
open work, like Brussels or Valenciennes lace, were
familiar to them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Being ignorant of who was the inventor of the
art of weaving, they attributed the honour to Athena,
who imparted a knowledge of it to Arachnè,<a id='r1289' /><a href='#f1289' class='c014'><sup>[1289]</sup></a> a virgin
of Mæonia, afterwards changed into a spider. But
spiders were not long the only weavers among the
Hellenes, who speedily invented the upright and
horizontal looms, which, in after times at least, were
constructed from the wood of the andrachnè.<a id='r1290' /><a href='#f1290' class='c014'><sup>[1290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the finest and most elegant fabrics of
Greece were those manufactured in the Achæan city
of Patræ,<a id='r1291' /><a href='#f1291' class='c014'><sup>[1291]</sup></a> where the women being twice as numerous
as the men, would alone appear to have worked
in the factories, from which the greater number of
the inhabitants, doubtless, derived their livelihood.
The flax, from which the fine linen and head-nets<a id='r1292' /><a href='#f1292' class='c014'><sup>[1292]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of this town were made, was not grown in the neighbourhood,
but in the plains of Elis,<a id='r1293' /><a href='#f1293' class='c014'><sup>[1293]</sup></a> where alone,
in Greece, the plant attained the highest degree of
perfection, not yielding in fineness to the best produced
in India, while it was possessed of superior
whiteness.<a id='r1294' /><a href='#f1294' class='c014'><sup>[1294]</sup></a> The fine cloths manufactured from it
sold for their weight in gold.<a id='r1295' /><a href='#f1295' class='c014'><sup>[1295]</sup></a> Another species of
very fine flax was cultivated in the island of Amorgos,<a id='r1296' /><a href='#f1296' class='c014'><sup>[1296]</sup></a>
where were likewise manufactured linens of
the most beautiful texture, frequently dyed purple,
on which account the word Amorgis<a id='r1297' /><a href='#f1297' class='c014'><sup>[1297]</sup></a> has sometimes
been supposed to denote a purple stuff, though the
fabrics of the island were as often white as of any
other colour. In imitation of the Egyptians, they wove
a sort of fine napkins, which were evidently used in
the same manner as our pocket-handkerchiefs.<a id='r1298' /><a href='#f1298' class='c014'><sup>[1298]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Even from hemp, very superior cloths were produced<a id='r1299' /><a href='#f1299' class='c014'><sup>[1299]</sup></a>
in antiquity, especially amongst the Thracians,
in whose country this plant was found both
in a cultivated and a wild state. It differed very
little from flax, except in its superior height and
thickness; and the fabrics manufactured from it were
not to be distinguished from linen, save by the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>experienced judges. From hair, too, they both wove
and plaited a variety of garments, among which
would seem to have been a sort of mantle for
ladies.<a id='r1300' /><a href='#f1300' class='c014'><sup>[1300]</sup></a> Sacks, too, were manufactured from the same
materials, together with socks, whips, and fishing-lines.
The Egyptians, we may observe by the way,
wove fine cloths and sails, and made ropes, from the
fibre of the papyrus plant,<a id='r1301' /><a href='#f1301' class='c014'><sup>[1301]</sup></a> as the Indians did from
a sort of grass or fine rush.<a id='r1302' /><a href='#f1302' class='c014'><sup>[1302]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the island of Cos existed, from a very early
age, the art of rearing silkworms and weaving silk.
As these insects, however, fed on the leaves of the
pine, the ash, and the oak, the white mulberry not
having been yet introduced into Greece, the silk they
produced was very different in quality from that of
China. The art of unwinding the cocoons and spinning
the threads was invented by Pamphila, daughter of
Plates,<a id='r1303' /><a href='#f1303' class='c014'><sup>[1303]</sup></a> who thus became the benefactress of her
country, whose fabrics were universally admired for
their delicacy, fineness, and transparency, since they
allowed the whole form and colour of the body to
be distinguished through them, like the gauze chemises
worn by the Turkish ladies in the recesses of
the harem.<a id='r1304' /><a href='#f1304' class='c014'><sup>[1304]</sup></a> Another kind of silk was manufactured
by the ancients from the floss-like beard of
the pinna marina, or silk-worm of the sea,<a id='r1305' /><a href='#f1305' class='c014'><sup>[1305]</sup></a> found on
the coasts of Asia Minor, Sicily, and the Balearic
isles. This kind of silk was evidently, at one period,
held in the highest estimation, since we find the
emperors of Rome bestowing robes of it as a mark
of their imperial favour on the satraps of Armenia.
In modern times, however, this branch of industry
has been almost totally neglected, though very warm
and beautiful winter gloves and stockings are still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>manufactured from it at Tarento. A pair of these
gloves was considered of sufficient importance to be
presented as a gift to Pope Benedict the Fourteenth.<a id='r1306' /><a href='#f1306' class='c014'><sup>[1306]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But not for lightness and fineness only were the
silks and other delicate fabrics of the ancients valued.
They were variegated<a id='r1307' /><a href='#f1307' class='c014'><sup>[1307]</sup></a> with stripes, lozenges,
the figures of birds and other animals, sprigs, flowers,<a id='r1308' /><a href='#f1308' class='c014'><sup>[1308]</sup></a>
and stars,<a id='r1309' /><a href='#f1309' class='c014'><sup>[1309]</sup></a> inwoven into their texture, and of the
most brilliant and beautiful colours.</p>

<p class='c001'>Occasionally, moreover, when the ground of the
whole tissue was white, a border of fanciful scrolls,
leaves, and flowers, intermingling their several tints,
extended round the whole robe or mantle, which
was sometimes also bedropped with asterisks of gold.
Their flowered silks, and cloths of various colours,
were worn, not only by ladies in their dresses, but
occasionally, also, by vain young men, who thus exposed
themselves to the derision of the multitude.
Bed-curtains, too, and the hangings of apartments<a id='r1310' /><a href='#f1310' class='c014'><sup>[1310]</sup></a>
were of variegated stuffs. In the manufacturing of
tapestry<a id='r1311' /><a href='#f1311' class='c014'><sup>[1311]</sup></a> and drapery for the statues and temples
of the gods, the greatest possible magnificence and
beauty were displayed. Whole years were devoted
to the production of a single piece, which exhibited
views of landscapes and cities, together with
figures of gods, and heroes, and groups of warriors,
sometimes arranged in religious processions, at other
times engaged in battle, where the scene, the combatants,
their armour, their weapons, and the flowing
gore were represented by various colours to the
life.<a id='r1312' /><a href='#f1312' class='c014'><sup>[1312]</sup></a> In the manufacture of carpets, the Greeks
displayed great taste and elegance, whether we regard
the figures of animals, trees, or flowers, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>which they were inwrought, or their pile, softness,
and texture.<a id='r1313' /><a href='#f1313' class='c014'><sup>[1313]</sup></a> Many times when they had not been
flowered by the hand of the weaver, they were
adorned by the ladies themselves with sprigs, and
leaves, and figures, in embroidery; sometimes of
various bright colours, at others with threads of
gold.<a id='r1314' /><a href='#f1314' class='c014'><sup>[1314]</sup></a> Even napkins in Egypt were embroidered
with golden flowers,<a id='r1315' /><a href='#f1315' class='c014'><sup>[1315]</sup></a> as both these and all kinds
of handkerchiefs still are throughout the East. In
Greece, the fine soft vests which warriors<a id='r1316' /><a href='#f1316' class='c014'><sup>[1316]</sup></a> wore
beneath their shirts of mail were usually figured
with rich embroidery by the females of their family.</p>

<p class='c001'>It appears to be generally supposed,<a id='r1317' /><a href='#f1317' class='c014'><sup>[1317]</sup></a> that silver
threads were not employed until a very recent period,
either in weaving or embroidery;<a id='r1318' /><a href='#f1318' class='c014'><sup>[1318]</sup></a> we find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>mention, however, in Philo Judæus,<a id='r1319' /><a href='#f1319' class='c014'><sup>[1319]</sup></a> of purple coverlets
inwrought with silver and gold. But at
length the love of show and magnificence rose to
so high a pitch, that robes were woven entirely of
threads of gold.<a id='r1320' /><a href='#f1320' class='c014'><sup>[1320]</sup></a> Ribbons also were manufactured
of the same materials, and several fragments of
these fabrics have more than once been discovered
in cinerary urns at Rome, though the greediness
of the finder has almost invariably led to their
being melted down.<a id='r1321' /><a href='#f1321' class='c014'><sup>[1321]</sup></a> At a later period stuffs were
woven partly of silk or woollen and partly of
gold.<a id='r1322' /><a href='#f1322' class='c014'><sup>[1322]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of gloves<a id='r1323' /><a href='#f1323' class='c014'><sup>[1323]</sup></a> the Greeks made little use, though
they must have observed very early, that they were
worn by the Persians, and probably by other nations
of Asia.<a id='r1324' /><a href='#f1324' class='c014'><sup>[1324]</sup></a> Nay even among their own rustics they
would appear to have been in fashion as far back
as the heroic ages.<a id='r1325' /><a href='#f1325' class='c014'><sup>[1325]</sup></a> The principal customers, therefore,
of the Hellenic glovers were the hedgers and
ditchers, woodmen, and actors; for on the stage it
was frequently necessary to appear in gloves,<a id='r1326' /><a href='#f1326' class='c014'><sup>[1326]</sup></a> either
in order to disguise the colour or augment the size
of the hands, or, as in the case of the Furies, to give
them the appearance of being furnished with talons
like those of the hippogriff.<a id='r1327' /><a href='#f1327' class='c014'><sup>[1327]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Stockings properly so called, were perhaps little
known to the Greeks, though we find mention made
of certain socks woven from the cotonaceous filaments
of a species of river truffle,<a id='r1328' /><a href='#f1328' class='c014'><sup>[1328]</sup></a> which must
have resembled them very closely both in form and
texture. Besides, we see in works of art representations
of this kind of sock reaching nearly to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>knees, and somewhat loose, which may probably
therefore have been woven. But the common sock,
like the hat, was of felt,<a id='r1329' /><a href='#f1329' class='c014'><sup>[1329]</sup></a> and usually white,<a id='r1330' /><a href='#f1330' class='c014'><sup>[1330]</sup></a> fitting
close to the foot and leg, and chiefly worn by women,
with shoes or sandals,<a id='r1331' /><a href='#f1331' class='c014'><sup>[1331]</sup></a> and sometimes in lieu
of them,<a id='r1332' /><a href='#f1332' class='c014'><sup>[1332]</sup></a> though in some cases it occupied the
same place in the costume of the Greeks as it does
in modern times.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Hellenic cordwainers<a id='r1333' /><a href='#f1333' class='c014'><sup>[1333]</sup></a> appear in every age to
have carried on a thriving trade, since all the world,
with the exception of a few philosophers, went well
shod. Their workshops seem to have been neatly
furnished. The shoes already made, whether plain
or gilded,<a id='r1334' /><a href='#f1334' class='c014'><sup>[1334]</sup></a> used to be ranged on shelves fixed up
against the wall with fanciful brackets, while their
lasts, pastepots, pincers, awls,<a id='r1335' /><a href='#f1335' class='c014'><sup>[1335]</sup></a> and other implements,
were kept in armories, sometimes furnished
with double folding-doors, four or five deep shelves,
and extremely elegant in form. Their cutting-boards<a id='r1336' /><a href='#f1336' class='c014'><sup>[1336]</sup></a>
were made from the wood of the wild pear-tree which
being of a close hard grain kept their knives constantly
in edge. Among the Israelites we find mention
made of shoes of badger-skins.<a id='r1337' /><a href='#f1337' class='c014'><sup>[1337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of the various processes resorted to for tanning,
dressing, and dyeing leather,<a id='r1338' /><a href='#f1338' class='c014'><sup>[1338]</sup></a> whether to be worked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>up into clothing, armour, shoes, or parchment, too
little by far is known. We are merely informed
that, in removing the hair from hides and skins,
they made use of the berries of the white briony;<a id='r1339' /><a href='#f1339' class='c014'><sup>[1339]</sup></a>
that, in preparing them for receiving any dye or
colour, the seeds of the sumach<a id='r1340' /><a href='#f1340' class='c014'><sup>[1340]</sup></a> were employed;
and that the bark of the fir-tree and the wood of
the alder,<a id='r1341' /><a href='#f1341' class='c014'><sup>[1341]</sup></a> reduced to chips, entered into various
preparations for dressing and dyeing.<a id='r1342' /><a href='#f1342' class='c014'><sup>[1342]</sup></a> Fawn-skins
among the Thracians were prepared probably with
the hair on,<a id='r1343' /><a href='#f1343' class='c014'><sup>[1343]</sup></a> for a sort of buskins,<a id='r1344' /><a href='#f1344' class='c014'><sup>[1344]</sup></a> and the skins
of sheep,<a id='r1345' /><a href='#f1345' class='c014'><sup>[1345]</sup></a> and dogs,<a id='r1346' /><a href='#f1346' class='c014'><sup>[1346]</sup></a> beavers,<a id='r1347' /><a href='#f1347' class='c014'><sup>[1347]</sup></a> otters, and badgers,
tanned in a variety of ways, sometimes with and
sometimes without the hair, were appropriated to
the manufacture of various articles of dress. Leather,
moreover, was dyed of every bright colour,<a id='r1348' /><a href='#f1348' class='c014'><sup>[1348]</sup></a>
purple, scarlet, and crimson, and occasionally gilded
or flowered with gold,<a id='r1349' /><a href='#f1349' class='c014'><sup>[1349]</sup></a> for sandals, thongs, and other
purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The manufacture of hats and caps,<a id='r1350' /><a href='#f1350' class='c014'><sup>[1350]</sup></a> though a less
important branch of industry than among the northern
nations of modern times, afforded nevertheless
employment to a pretty numerous class of persons.
At Athens it was not fashionable in fine weather
to wear a hat at all, chiefly, perhaps, because the
practice was supposed to hasten the approach of grey
hairs;<a id='r1351' /><a href='#f1351' class='c014'><sup>[1351]</sup></a> but in those seasons of the year when sudden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>showers were looked for, cautious persons seldom
went abroad without their broad-brim, which being
furnished with a long skin thong was suffered to
fall back and hang over the shoulders. If they
happened to be caught by the rain when not thus
provided, they threw, like Strepsiades in the Clouds,
a corner of their mantle over the head. These hats
were of various shapes,<a id='r1352' /><a href='#f1352' class='c014'><sup>[1352]</sup></a> and manufactured of very
different materials; sometimes square or lozenge-formed,
like our college-caps: sometimes round with
broad leaf<a id='r1353' /><a href='#f1353' class='c014'><sup>[1353]</sup></a> and low basinet crown; sometimes peaked
atop with rim curling all round like the bell of the
Egyptian lotos. There was another modification of
the hat,<a id='r1354' /><a href='#f1354' class='c014'><sup>[1354]</sup></a> fashioned like a limpet-shell, and without
a brim, chiefly worn by fishermen and poor operatives,
and sometimes also by travellers.<a id='r1355' /><a href='#f1355' class='c014'><sup>[1355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The cynic, Menippos, however, when making his
round through Thebes, in the costume of a Fury,
wore a broad-brimmed Arcadian hat, on which were
represented the twelve signs of the zodiac.<a id='r1356' /><a href='#f1356' class='c014'><sup>[1356]</sup></a> Among
the Macedonians, who in all things affected magnificence,
the hats of the courtiers and nobles were
purple,<a id='r1357' /><a href='#f1357' class='c014'><sup>[1357]</sup></a> like the tiara of the Persians,<a id='r1358' /><a href='#f1358' class='c014'><sup>[1358]</sup></a> which, however,
was furnished with side-flaps, resembling a
peacock’s wings. The most common material was
felt, though they were likewise made of leather.
Caps were ordinarily manufactured of dog, or sheep,
or lamb skin.<a id='r1359' /><a href='#f1359' class='c014'><sup>[1359]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But if in some of these branches of the useful arts
the Greeks approached, and, perhaps, equalled, the
moderns, in another they probably excelled them;
I mean in dyeing,<a id='r1360' /><a href='#f1360' class='c014'><sup>[1360]</sup></a> more particularly, that deep crimson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>or purple, of which Greek and Roman authors
so often speak with an admiration bordering on rapture.
Winkelmann<a id='r1361' /><a href='#f1361' class='c014'><sup>[1361]</sup></a> is not far wrong in supposing
there were two kinds of purple, the one containing
a tinge of violet, or sea-blue, produced at Tarentum,<a id='r1362' /><a href='#f1362' class='c014'><sup>[1362]</sup></a>
the other resembling our lake, known in antiquity
as Tyrian dye. On the origin of this colour the ancients
had many legends (for they loved to build a
mythos on what they could not explain), from among
which we shall select the most poetical. The Tyrian
Heracles loved, they say, a nymph, who dwelt somewhere
about the sea-coast, and her name, it is added,
was Tyros. In visiting this young lady, Heracles,
according to the custom of the heroic age, was accompanied
by his dog, as we find Telemachos, in
the Odyssey. This same dog, not having love to
support him, grew hungry by the way, and espying
a purple fish upon a rock, with its head protruding
from the shell, he seized, and devoured it. On Heracles
reaching the residence of the nymph, she observed
the muzzle of the animal dyed of a bright
purple, and, in the style of a froward beauty, declared
she would never again see her lover until
he brought her a dress of that colour. Now this
hero, as all the world knows, or may learn from the
comic poets, was always more remarkable for courage
and gluttony than for invention. Love, however,
on the present occasion, sharpened his wits.
He discovered the fish, turned dyer, and, having produced
such an article as the lady required, had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>honour of being esteemed the inventor of the Tyrian
purple.<a id='r1363' /><a href='#f1363' class='c014'><sup>[1363]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The writer to whom we are indebted for this fable,
which he related for the amusement of Commodus,
has preserved a valuable account of the purple fishery
as carried on by the Phœnicians. They fastened, he
observes,<a id='r1364' /><a href='#f1364' class='c014'><sup>[1364]</sup></a> a number of small bell-formed baskets, at
regular distances, to a long, stout, and tough cable,
capable of resisting the action of the sea. These
baskets, like the eel-traps of modern times, were
surrounded at the mouth with a circle of slender
twigs<a id='r1365' /><a href='#f1365' class='c014'><sup>[1365]</sup></a> projecting inward, and almost meeting at
the centre, resembling the bottom of a claret bottle,
but with an opening through which the fish could
easily force its way in, though the twigs closing with
a spring behind it prevented its egress. To entice
the prey, there was a bait in the basket, which, according
to some, was a cockle, according to others, a
frog, upon a hook,<a id='r1366' /><a href='#f1366' class='c014'><sup>[1366]</sup></a> so that assurance was made doubly
sure. All things thus prepared, the fisherman conveyed
the apparatus to a rocky part of the shore,
where they let it down, having previously fastened
to it a strong cord with a piece of cork at the end,
that they might be able to discover and pull it up.
Leaving their traps there all night and all the ensuing
day, they generally took up the basket full.
Then, pounding both shell and flesh together, to prepare
it for dyeing they cleansed away all impurities
with water, and boiled the whole in a cauldron. The
blood, being of an oily nature, melted on coming
in contact with the heat and acquired its rich colour.
Not always did it assume the same tint, but was
sometimes yellow, sometimes a deep violet, and,
occasionally, some other shade. Into this whatever
was dipped immediately took the tincture of it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Nor did it all fade in the sun; but, on the contrary,
rejoiced in the rays of light, as it were, its brightness
imparting additional brilliance, and heightening
the bloom and splendour of its tints.<a id='r1367' /><a href='#f1367' class='c014'><sup>[1367]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Wherever, and by whomsoever, discovered, the
purple was known in the time of Moses, who introduced
it into the costume of the high priest,
and among the ornaments of the tabernacle.<a id='r1368' /><a href='#f1368' class='c014'><sup>[1368]</sup></a> Homer,<a id='r1369' /><a href='#f1369' class='c014'><sup>[1369]</sup></a>
too, speaks of purple among the colours worn
by his heroes, for example, a large purple pelisse.
Iris is denominated “purple;” we have mention,
also, of a “purple cloak, of a purple ball wherewith
to play;” “purple coverings,” of great beauty, for
beds, or seats; “purple carpets;” “purple threads,”
where the “sea-purple” is distinctly spoken of.<a id='r1370' /><a href='#f1370' class='c014'><sup>[1370]</sup></a>
Again, in another part of the Odyssey, we find it
said, that women wove the “purple cloaks.”<a id='r1371' /><a href='#f1371' class='c014'><sup>[1371]</sup></a> The
President Goguet has entered into many useful investigations
respecting the manner in which the Tyrian
dye was used; but at the outset confounds
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>conchyliatæ vestes</i></span> with the purple garments,
though Pliny, on whom he chiefly relies, constantly
distinguishes them. The dye was obtained from
several kinds of shell-fish<a id='r1372' /><a href='#f1372' class='c014'><sup>[1372]</sup></a> found in the Mediterranean,
the best on the island on which New Tyre was
built.<a id='r1373' /><a href='#f1373' class='c014'><sup>[1373]</sup></a> Aristotle, who of all the ancients has best
described the purple fish, observes, that there were
several species, of which some were of considerable
size, such as those caught near Sigeion and Lecton;
while those found on the coast of Caria and in the
Euripos were small. Generally, he says, such as
inhabited bays or arms of the sea were large and
rough, and contained a liquid of blackish hue, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>sometimes it was reddish, and small in quantity.
Some of these were a mina, or about seventeen
ounces, in weight. Those caught close along shores,
or about headlands were usually of small size, but
the dye they yielded was of a ruddier tinge. In
general, too, it was thought that those found on
northern coasts produced a darker, those on southern
coasts a ruddier dye.<a id='r1374' /><a href='#f1374' class='c014'><sup>[1374]</sup></a> Purple fisheries were carried
on on the coast of Africa, near the island of Menninx,
and on the shores of Getulia.<a id='r1375' /><a href='#f1375' class='c014'><sup>[1375]</sup></a> So, likewise, in Europe,<a id='r1376' /><a href='#f1376' class='c014'><sup>[1376]</sup></a>
on the coast of Laconia,<a id='r1377' /><a href='#f1377' class='c014'><sup>[1377]</sup></a> whose purple was
greatly celebrated; in the Euripos, as we have seen
above;<a id='r1378' /><a href='#f1378' class='c014'><sup>[1378]</sup></a> and in the terrible southern bend of Eubœa,
beneath the cliffs of Mount Caphareus.<a id='r1379' /><a href='#f1379' class='c014'><sup>[1379]</sup></a> An inferior
kind of purple was obtained from the buccinum,<a id='r1380' /><a href='#f1380' class='c014'><sup>[1380]</sup></a>
but the genuine dye was produced by the <em>calchè</em>
alone. The colour was contained in a white vein
about the neck, the remainder of the fish being of
no value. To secure, this, however, it was necessary
to take the fish alive, for at its death the colour
fled. Having been carefully collected, and left to
macerate in salt<a id='r1381' /><a href='#f1381' class='c014'><sup>[1381]</sup></a> during three days, it was mixed
with a certain quantity of water. The whole was
then boiled for ten days in leaden boilers over a
slow fire.<a id='r1382' /><a href='#f1382' class='c014'><sup>[1382]</sup></a> After this the wool well washed, cleansed
and properly prepared, was dipped into it. Here
it was allowed to soak during five hours. It was
then taken out, dried, carded, and thrown back,
where it was suffered to remain till it imbibed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>whole of the dye.<a id='r1383' /><a href='#f1383' class='c014'><sup>[1383]</sup></a> To this double-dyed purple the
poets often allude. Thus Horace:</p>

<p class='c016'>It was seldom or never considered sufficient to
rely upon one species of fish. Usually several kinds
were mingled together;<a id='r1387' /><a href='#f1387' class='c014'><sup>[1387]</sup></a> and to the mixture were
added many other ingredients, as nitre, urine, water,
salt, and the fucus—a kind of moss—by some writers
supposed to be our argol,<a id='r1388' /><a href='#f1388' class='c014'><sup>[1388]</sup></a> found in abundance on
the rocky shores of Crete.<a id='r1389' /><a href='#f1389' class='c014'><sup>[1389]</sup></a> The tint produced by
this mixture resembled the colour of the amethyst.<a id='r1390' /><a href='#f1390' class='c014'><sup>[1390]</sup></a>
For, under the word purple, the ancients
included three distinct colours,—the first a deep
violet with a black or dusky tinge, designed by
Homer, when he speaks of the “purple wave,” or of
“purple death.” This was the amethystine shade
spoken of as so magnificent by Pliny; produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>by the calchæ and buccina alone. The second which
resembled deep scarlet or crimson, which is the
colour of a ripe pomegranate, was the purple of
Tyre and Tarentum. The third was the deep blue
of the Mediterranean sea, when it begins to be
ruffled by the winds; a variety produced by the
buccinum alone, and always understood by the word
conchyliata.<a id='r1391' /><a href='#f1391' class='c014'><sup>[1391]</sup></a> Near the Isthmus of Darien, a sea-snail
has been discovered, which some have supposed
to be the murex of the ancients. In dimensions
it is about equal to the bee. Being of
extremely rare occurrence, the Indian fishermen
preserve it, when found, in a vessel of water until
they have collected a sufficient quantity for dyeing
a piece of stuff. They then, like the ancient
Tyrians, pound it shell and all with a smooth stone
or something which serves them for a mortar, which
as the shell is extremely thin and frail is a task
of little labour, and immediately dip the cotton
yarn or stuff in the liquor thus obtained. The
colour resulting from this operation is the richest
purple that can be conceived, which instead of
fading by being passed through water grows more
lustrous and brilliant the more it is washed. Stuffs
dyed in this manner are, as may be supposed, exceedingly
costly, and on account of their beauty
much coveted by the richest of the Indian women.<a id='r1392' /><a href='#f1392' class='c014'><sup>[1392]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The fucus above-mentioned, found on the shores
of Crete, was sometimes employed separately in
dyeing fillets, garments, and wool, and the colour
thus produced was still more brilliant than that of
the purple fish, though no means of fixing it could
be discovered.<a id='r1393' /><a href='#f1393' class='c014'><sup>[1393]</sup></a> The purple of Hermione, however,
preserved its lustre and freshness for centuries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Alexander, for example, found in the royal palace
of Susa vast quantities of purple garments dyed at
Hermione, which, though they had been laid up
nearly two hundred years, exhibited all their pristine
bloom and beauty; because, observes the historian,
the wool had been previously combed with
white oil, and the colour fixed with honey.<a id='r1394' /><a href='#f1394' class='c014'><sup>[1394]</sup></a> Even
in Plutarch’s own time garments of equal age were
to be seen, the purple of which had preserved its
brilliance and splendour undiminished. Nay, a small
pot of the dye was discovered at Pompeii which
though covered atop with a thick tawny film had
preserved all the deep tone and richness attributed
to the Tyrian purple by the ancients.</p>

<p class='c001'>In dyeing scarlet, the ancients made use of kermes<a id='r1395' /><a href='#f1395' class='c014'><sup>[1395]</sup></a>
or cochineal, found in several parts of Greece, but
imported likewise from various other countries. It
was sometimes employed in giving the ground to
purple stuffs.<a id='r1396' /><a href='#f1396' class='c014'><sup>[1396]</sup></a> Garments of this colour would appear
to have been extremely rare among the Orientals,
since the admiration excited in Darius by the
scarlet cloak of Syloson, whom he saw walking in
the great square of Memphis, can be accounted for
only by supposing that he had never beheld the like
before;<a id='r1397' /><a href='#f1397' class='c014'><sup>[1397]</sup></a> otherwise he would not have been so captivated
by its magnificent colour as to press its
wearer to sell it to him in the street. Syloson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>presented him the cloak as a gift; but afterwards,
when Darius was king of Persia, he took care to
proceed to court and make the circumstance known,
upon which the generous prince overwhelmed him
with his favours. This kind of dye appears to have
been known in Greece from the remotest antiquity,
since Simonides supposes that even the signal
sail given by Ægeus to Theseus in his expedition to
Crete was of a scarlet colour.<a id='r1398' /><a href='#f1398' class='c014'><sup>[1398]</sup></a> Sardis was celebrated
for its scarlet,<a id='r1399' /><a href='#f1399' class='c014'><sup>[1399]</sup></a> whence the proverb,—to be dyed
with the tincture of Sardis,—for, to be beaten black
and blue. The ancients, however, generally mistook the
insect for the fruit of the holm-oak, upon whose leaves
it feeds; a circumstance which may be regarded as
very extraordinary, when it is remembered that both
the insect and the tree were daily under their eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The wool of sheep is said by the Greek poets to
have been dyed red on their backs by eating the
madder plant.<a id='r1400' /><a href='#f1400' class='c014'><sup>[1400]</sup></a> The wool of brown sheep was spun,
woven, and worn of its natural colour, as it is still
by the rustics of several European countries. Dyes
of every other colour were likewise known to the
ancients; as bright flame and saffron-colour, pink,
green, and russet grey;<a id='r1401' /><a href='#f1401' class='c014'><sup>[1401]</sup></a> deep and sky-blue, produced
by woad;<a id='r1402' /><a href='#f1402' class='c014'><sup>[1402]</sup></a> and red by madder.<a id='r1403' /><a href='#f1403' class='c014'><sup>[1403]</sup></a> The Phrygian dyers
made use of a kind of mineral<a id='r1404' /><a href='#f1404' class='c014'><sup>[1404]</sup></a> obtained from Cappadocia;
and wool was sometimes dyed with a decoction
of beans.<a id='r1405' /><a href='#f1405' class='c014'><sup>[1405]</sup></a> Among the Egyptians, linens, muslins,
and all kinds of cloths were painted with flowers
and figures, in a great variety of colours;<a id='r1406' /><a href='#f1406' class='c014'><sup>[1406]</sup></a> which
was the case, also, among the Massagetæ, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>impressed on their fine woollen cloths a multitude
of patterns, which preserved their brilliance unfading
to the last.<a id='r1407' /><a href='#f1407' class='c014'><sup>[1407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As many kinds of woollens are wholly spoiled by
common washing,<a id='r1408' /><a href='#f1408' class='c014'><sup>[1408]</sup></a> they were regularly, when soiled,
carried by the Greeks to the fullers,<a id='r1409' /><a href='#f1409' class='c014'><sup>[1409]</sup></a> whose mill and
trade are supposed to have been invented by Nycias of
Megara.<a id='r1410' /><a href='#f1410' class='c014'><sup>[1410]</sup></a> These artisans made use of numerous earths
and other substances in their operations; such as gypsum,<a id='r1411' /><a href='#f1411' class='c014'><sup>[1411]</sup></a>
the Cimolian earth and the Chian, the Lemnian,
the Sardian, the Umbrian, the Samian, the Tymphæan,
and the Chalastræan.<a id='r1412' /><a href='#f1412' class='c014'><sup>[1412]</sup></a> Wool, previous to being
spun, was cleansed by soap-wort.<a id='r1413' /><a href='#f1413' class='c014'><sup>[1413]</sup></a> In washing clothes
they commonly made use of a lye prepared with
lime or wood ashes.<a id='r1414' /><a href='#f1414' class='c014'><sup>[1414]</sup></a> Sponges were blanched in the
following manner:<a id='r1415' /><a href='#f1415' class='c014'><sup>[1415]</sup></a> over such as were extremely soft
they sprinkled a quantity of salt-fish, collected from
the rocks, after which they were carefully washed,
and laid in the summer sun with their hollow part
uppermost. They were rendered still whiter by being
saturated with salt froth or sea-water, and exposed
during a succession of calm summer nights to the
moon’s rays.</p>

<p class='c001'>The extent and importance of the Grecian fisheries<a id='r1416' /><a href='#f1416' class='c014'><sup>[1416]</sup></a>
may be inferred from the prodigious quantities
of fish eaten in every part of Greece; for
although they knew nothing in antiquity of those
long fasts during which the members of the Greek
church in modern times, ceasing to prey upon the
dumb inhabitants of terra firma, let loose their voracity
against those of the sea, they were no less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>partial to this kind of food than their descendants,<a id='r1417' /><a href='#f1417' class='c014'><sup>[1417]</sup></a>
as will have been seen from a preceding portion of
this work. Fisheries were accordingly established
on nearly every part of the coast of Hellas, as well
as of those islands and distant colonies of which
she became mistress.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus a celebrated lamprey<a id='r1418' /><a href='#f1418' class='c014'><sup>[1418]</sup></a> fishery existed on the
Faro of Messina, an eel-fishery at Syracuse,<a id='r1419' /><a href='#f1419' class='c014'><sup>[1419]</sup></a> another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>for taking the purple fish, on the eastern coast of
Eubœa, a second on the shores of Laconia, a third
at Sigæum in Asia Minor, and a fourth in the
neighbourhood of Tyre and Sidon.<a id='r1420' /><a href='#f1420' class='c014'><sup>[1420]</sup></a> Whales and
dolphins were caught in the Mediterranean, and in
the Black Sea; thunnies in the same sea, on the
Bosporos, in the sea of Marmora, in the Hellespont,
in the Adriatic, and in nearly all the eastern
parts of the Mediterranean. Many kinds of smaller
fish afforded employment to numerous bodies of men
in the gulfs and bays of Attica and the Peloponnesos;
and flourishing sponge-fisheries were carried
on along the coast of Crete, and in several other
parts of the Archipelago.<a id='r1421' /><a href='#f1421' class='c014'><sup>[1421]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In seas frequented by sharks, sponge-fishers necessarily
incurred much risk. They therefore carefully
observed every circumstance denoting the absence
of danger, as for example, the appearance of the
anthias,<a id='r1422' /><a href='#f1422' class='c014'><sup>[1422]</sup></a> which is supposed never to be seen in the
neighbourhood of any voracious sea-monster; for
which reason it obtained from the Greeks the name
of the Sacred Fish.</p>

<p class='c001'>The divers engaged in this trade made use, moreover,
of many contrivances to diminish the toil and
hazard of their dangerous calling. Sometimes they
poured oil<a id='r1423' /><a href='#f1423' class='c014'><sup>[1423]</sup></a> upon the waves, which rendered them
at once more tranquil and translucent and enabled
them the better to carry on their operations at the
bottom of the sea. They made likewise the first
step towards the invention of the diving-bell, by
descending with a large vessel turned upside down
upon their heads, taking care that its edges sank
into the water at the same instant, by which means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>they carried along with them a quantity of air, and
were enabled to continue a considerable space of
time beneath the surface.<a id='r1424' /><a href='#f1424' class='c014'><sup>[1424]</sup></a> A diver and his daughter
are said to have performed good service for their
country during the Median war; for, descending
into the sea during a tempest, they loosened the
anchors of many Persian vessels, and thus set them
adrift to perish by the weather; in remembrance
of which services, a statue was erected to both
father and daughter at Delphi.<a id='r1425' /><a href='#f1425' class='c014'><sup>[1425]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The business of fishing was pursued in much the
same manner as in modern times. Great numbers
of smacks,<a id='r1426' /><a href='#f1426' class='c014'><sup>[1426]</sup></a> of all dimensions, crowded the narrow
seas between the islands and the main, making
sometimes pretty long voyages, and taking passengers
to augment their gains.<a id='r1427' /><a href='#f1427' class='c014'><sup>[1427]</sup></a> These, moreover,
formed the principal nurseries for the Grecian navies,<a id='r1428' /><a href='#f1428' class='c014'><sup>[1428]</sup></a>
particularly those of Athens, which consequently
were manned, in the better ages of the
republic, by the hardiest and most expert seamen
in the ancient world. They employed in their operations
both the harpoon and various kinds of large
nets;<a id='r1429' /><a href='#f1429' class='c014'><sup>[1429]</sup></a> and the ease and rapidity with which they
filled their vessels may be inferred from the accounts
given in modern times of the vast shoals of fish of
all species and dimensions which in spring time collect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>in the eastern extremity of the Mediterranean,
and pour in such multitudes into the narrow stream
of the Dardanelles and the Bosporos,<a id='r1430' /><a href='#f1430' class='c014'><sup>[1430]</sup></a> that, with
one sweep of a net, the fishermen are enabled to
fill whole skiffs, while they may be taken by the
hand from the shores, killed like birds with stones,
caught with unbaited hooks, or by the women in
common baskets, let down by ropes from the windows
of such houses in Constantinople<a id='r1431' /><a href='#f1431' class='c014'><sup>[1431]</sup></a> as happen
to stand on the beach. Elsewhere the fishermen
made use of stop-nets in rivers or along the sea-coasts
where the water for some way out was shallow.
Various kinds of baskets,<a id='r1432' /><a href='#f1432' class='c014'><sup>[1432]</sup></a> also, they had
recourse to, together with the rod and line. Even
that barbarous method, still in many parts of Europe
put in practice by the vulgar, of poisoning
the waters, was known to the Greeks, who, for this
purpose, cast into streams or ponds the pounded
leaves of the Euphorbia Platyphylla.<a id='r1433' /><a href='#f1433' class='c014'><sup>[1433]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the land-locked seas, also, and lakes, and
rivers, they pursued that striking and romantic species
of fishery<a id='r1434' /><a href='#f1434' class='c014'><sup>[1434]</sup></a> carried on at night,<a id='r1435' /><a href='#f1435' class='c014'><sup>[1435]</sup></a> in which a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>flaming torch held at the boats’ bows allures the
fish to the surface, where by their bright eyes and
glittering scales shining through the transparent
water, they directed the aim of the fisherman’s
trident.<a id='r1436' /><a href='#f1436' class='c014'><sup>[1436]</sup></a> A small fleet of this kind of boats dispersed
over a smooth sea under the lea of woody
headlands or rocky shores, each with its bright
red light, gliding noiselessly<a id='r1437' /><a href='#f1437' class='c014'><sup>[1437]</sup></a> hither and thither, discloses
a scene of singular beauty to the imagination.
In the paintings of Herculaneum,<a id='r1438' /><a href='#f1438' class='c014'><sup>[1438]</sup></a> we find
a landscape representing a group of fishermen immediately
before day, when the dusky shadows are
beginning to be dispersed by the first straggling
rays of light which barely enable us to distinguish
the boats, the nets, the rods, the fishermen themselves,
and the picturesque shore on which they
are at work.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most profitable of the Greek fisheries
was that of the thunny, which commenced about
the rising of the Pleiades and terminated shortly
after the setting of Arcturus.<a id='r1439' /><a href='#f1439' class='c014'><sup>[1439]</sup></a> As this animal always
moves about in troops, and swims near the
surface of the water, which it visibly disturbs in its
progress, at the same time blowing sportively, and
uttering a loud noise, the fishermen, on the shores
frequented by it, constantly stationed a number of
watchmen along the beach, some perched aloft on
the summits of cliffs, others on detached rocks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>rising out of the waves, or in trees, or on the top
of masts set up at certain distances along the coast,
that they might give notice of the approach of the
thunnies.<a id='r1440' /><a href='#f1440' class='c014'><sup>[1440]</sup></a> As soon as the signal was given the fishermen
pushed out with their barks, making a wide
circuit, so as to take the fish in flank. Then letting
down their long nets furnished with leaden
weights to sink them, and with cords<a id='r1441' /><a href='#f1441' class='c014'><sup>[1441]</sup></a> wherewith
to draw them up, they formed themselves into a
semicircle, which rapidly narrowing round the shoal
drove them towards the land, by which means the
greatest number were either taken in the nets, or
speared by tridents.<a id='r1442' /><a href='#f1442' class='c014'><sup>[1442]</sup></a> Respecting one of these fishing
stations, on the coast of Cypros, a very romantic
anecdote is related.<a id='r1443' /><a href='#f1443' class='c014'><sup>[1443]</sup></a> The inhabitants we are
told, having sculptured a marble lion, which they
adorned with emerald eyes, set it up on the tomb
of a prince of the country named Hermias,<a id='r1444' /><a href='#f1444' class='c014'><sup>[1444]</sup></a> upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>an eminence overlooking the sea. The splendour
of the emerald, penetrating through the waves,
scared away the thunnies, which in truth are remarkable
for their timidity, so that the fishermen
of that part of the island must unquestionably have
been ruined had they not discovered the property
of their lion’s optics, and substituted in lieu of
the emerald, eyes less terrible to the pusillanimous
herds of Thetis. A circumstance almost
equally extraordinary is related of the strait by
which the stream of the Bosporos disgorges itself
into the Propontis. Here they say a rock of marvellous
whiteness is discovered on the Asiatic side
through the waves in the neighbourhood of Chalcedon,
which by its brightness scares away the thunnies,
both in their way to and from the Black
Sea. The ancient naturalists remark, that the thunny
in this part of its migrations observes steadily one
course, keeping generally on the Asiatic side in the
ascent to the Pontus, where, excepting the seal and
the dolphin, nothing destructive to fish is found,
and, after making the circuit of its shores, returning
to the Ægæan close along the coast of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>This proceeding they account for by supposing that,
of its two dull eyes, the right sees best, and that,
in obedience to the guidance of this peeper, it makes
the circuit of the sea in the manner stated. A
better reason may be, that its peculiar food<a id='r1445' /><a href='#f1445' class='c014'><sup>[1445]</sup></a> is most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>plentiful on the Asiatic coast in spring, and on the
European in autumn, if, after all, we are to regard
the fact itself as well established.<a id='r1446' /><a href='#f1446' class='c014'><sup>[1446]</sup></a> In this traject,
however, it seems in reality, for some cause or another,
to shun the vicinity of the City of the Blind,
which constituted, perhaps, one of the principal causes
of its inferiority to Byzantium. Nevertheless, a very
delicate species of pelamys,<a id='r1447' /><a href='#f1447' class='c014'><sup>[1447]</sup></a> caught there, was known
in the commerce of the ancient world, and transported
to all parts of Greece.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have remarked above, that the taking of the
thunny commenced in spring, when it appears to have
been in excellent condition, and very highly prized.
During winter, whatever may have been its quality,
it was not to be caught, since it retired to the
depths of the Ægæan, beyond the reach of nets or
tridents. In the heat of summer it was rendered
lean and flabby by the persecution of a kind of
worm, which, insinuating itself beneath the fins,<a id='r1448' /><a href='#f1448' class='c014'><sup>[1448]</sup></a>
harassed it incessantly. But, towards autumn, being
delivered by nature from this pest, it again became
plump, and was esteemed excellent eating. The
growth of this fish is extremely rapid, more especially
in the Black Sea, where, amid the vast quantities
of mud and slime brought down by the numerous
rivers, it finds in great abundance the food
most congenial to its taste.<a id='r1449' /><a href='#f1449' class='c014'><sup>[1449]</sup></a> The thunny, properly
so called, is at present<a id='r1450' /><a href='#f1450' class='c014'><sup>[1450]</sup></a> scarce along the coast of
Mingrelia, where, by the ancients, it is said to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>abounded, which renders it not improbable, that
they included under this name more than one species
of sturgeon, a fish still found in great numbers
in those parts of the Black Sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>The method of taking the pelamys<a id='r1451' /><a href='#f1451' class='c014'><sup>[1451]</sup></a> has been
graphically described by an ancient writer. A well-appointed
and swift bark, putting to sea with her
rowers, dashed out as rapidly as possible into deep
water, upon which one of the crew, stationed at
the stern, let down the tackle. This consisted of
two strong ropes, one on either side, to which were
attached a number of small cords, each with a hook
at the end, baited with the Laconian purple fish,
and garnished with a feather of the sea-mew, which,
glancing hither and thither in the currents of the
sea, assisted in attracting the eye of the pelamydes.
The boat then traced various lines upon the surface
of the deep, now skimming in this direction,
now in that, until it was followed by a shoal of
fish, which, coming up with it, voraciously gorged
the baits until not a single hook was left without
its prey. Upon this the rowers desisted from their
toil, and, pulling up the ropes, generally found their
boat laden with the take.<a id='r1452' /><a href='#f1452' class='c014'><sup>[1452]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The manner in which the thunny is taken on the
coast of Chili may, perhaps, be worth mentioning for
the sake of comparison. As soon as the Indians
discover a shoal of these fish near the shore they
put to sea on large sealskin floats inflated, like bladders,
with air, carrying with them a sharp-pronged
trident, fastened to a tough and very long rope.
They then approach and pierce the fish, which, immediately
upon being struck, darts out to sea with
prodigious celerity, the Indian, meanwhile, rapidly
uncoiling his rope till the strength of the thunny
is spent through loss of blood, after which he draws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>back his prey, and, raising it upon his float, returns
to the shore rejoicing.<a id='r1453' /><a href='#f1453' class='c014'><sup>[1453]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable that, in this manner of fishing, the
Indian draws near the thunny while asleep,<a id='r1454' /><a href='#f1454' class='c014'><sup>[1454]</sup></a> as we
find to have been often the practice among the
Greek fishermen, who when they went forth at night,
at which time the thunny is exceedingly drowsy,
were attracted towards their prey by the white
belly of the fish sleeping quietly on the surface of
the water. Many other kinds of fish also appear
to have been taken while asleep, notwithstanding
that in general their slumbers are brief. Thus flat-fish,
nestling in the sand or mud, were discovered
through the transparent water, and pierced with the
trident. So likewise the sea-dog, the gilthead, and
the mullet, were taken by day, with the trident,
while asleep; otherwise it has been thought they
could scarcely be touched by this instrument. The
skate and other fishes of the Selachian tribe were
sometimes found to sleep so soundly, that they could
be taken by the hand.<a id='r1455' /><a href='#f1455' class='c014'><sup>[1455]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the shores of the Chelidonian isles there was
a celebrated anthias fishery which was carried on
in a peculiar manner. The fishermen putting to
sea in their bark, and clad in garments of a sober
colour, sailed backward and forward daily in the
same place and at the same hour. By this means,
the anthias, which in great numbers frequents that
part of the sea, became accustomed to the sight
of the vessel, and by degrees approached it, one
of the shoal generally preceding the rest. To him
the fishermen threw out something of which the
anthias is fond, and continued to do so until the
fish became so tame that they would eat food from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>his hand. A hook was then introduced into the
bait, and as the fish crowded around the bark in
prodigious multitudes, they were caught rapidly, and
handed to a second person, who threw them into
the bottom of the boat upon heaps of soft rags, lest
by their bounding and struggling they should make
a noise and frighten away their companions. The
shadow of the boat assisted in concealing this man&oelig;uvre
from the fish. It was considered necessary
to spare the anthias which first approached, since,
being probably a kind of leader, his disappearance
instantly put all the rest to flight.<a id='r1456' /><a href='#f1456' class='c014'><sup>[1456]</sup></a> Sometimes it
is said multitudes of these fish were collected round
the boat by the striking of two bits of wood together
in the manner of castanets.<a id='r1457' /><a href='#f1457' class='c014'><sup>[1457]</sup></a> The Milesians<a id='r1458' /><a href='#f1458' class='c014'><sup>[1458]</sup></a>
possessed close to their city a very lucrative fishery
chiefly of the sea-dog,<a id='r1459' /><a href='#f1459' class='c014'><sup>[1459]</sup></a> which there attained a larger
size than anywhere else. This is supposed to have
been owing to an extensive lagoon of fresh water,
having however with the sea a channel of communication
through which these fish found their way in,
where they grew tame and fat, and were taken in
great numbers.<a id='r1460' /><a href='#f1460' class='c014'><sup>[1460]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At a point on the gulf of Smyrna, a productive
fishery is at present carried on in a very ingenious
manner. The shore being low and level, a continuous
sweep of reed-fences is stretched along, so
as to enclose a considerable space of water, and
furnished at intervals with gates, which are raised
occasionally for letting in the shoals. The avenues
are then closed, and the fish taken with facility.
On the coast of China a similar fishery is found,
lines of mats being substituted for reeds.<a id='r1461' /><a href='#f1461' class='c014'><sup>[1461]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>There was a small, but apparently productive,
fishery in the canton of Marathon.<a id='r1462' /><a href='#f1462' class='c014'><sup>[1462]</sup></a> The right
of fishing in the salt stream of the Rheitæ was
secured by law to the priests of Eleusis,<a id='r1463' /><a href='#f1463' class='c014'><sup>[1463]</sup></a> whose
city was famous for the scombros as well as for
soles or turbots.<a id='r1464' /><a href='#f1464' class='c014'><sup>[1464]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1314'>1314</a>. One of the most extraordinary
productions of the Grecian
loom seems to have been that
magnificent chlamys which was
weaving for king Demetrius at
the period of his overthrow. It
had been, we are told, a long
time in hand, and represented in
one vast picture both the face of
the earth, and heaven with all its
constellations. But it was never
completed, none of the succeeding
sovereigns of Macedon possessing
the gorgeous taste of the son of
Antigonos. Plut. Demet. § 41.
Next perhaps to this in curious
workmanship may be reckoned
that rich mantle fifteen cubits in
length, which the Sybarite Alcisthenes
exhibited on Mount Lacinium
during the festival of Hera,
which was frequented by all the
people of Italy. Dionysios, the
elder, obtaining possession of this
garment, sold it to the Carthaginians
for a hundred and twenty
talents. It was of a rich sea
purple colour, and surrounded on
all sides by a border containing
the figures of animals, the upper
row consisting of those of Susiana,
the lower of those of Persia Proper.
In the middle appeared an
assembly of the gods—Zeus, Hera,
Themis, Athena, Apollo, and Aphroditè.
At either end stood a
figure of Alcisthenes himself with
a representation, probably symbolical
of the city of Sybaris.
All these figures were the produce
of the loom, and not of the
needle. Aristot. de Mirab. Auscult.

however, considered the ancient
purple very inferior to our own:
“By the discovery of cochineal,
&amp;c., we far surpass the colours
of antiquity. Their royal purple
had a strong smell, and a
dark cast, as deep as bull’s
blood—obscuritas rubens (says
Cassiodorus, Var. i. 2,) nigredo
sanguinea. The president, Goguet,
will <em>amuse</em> and <em>satisfy</em>
the reader.” Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire, vii. 90.
<em>Note.</em> Goguet will, no doubt,
amuse and instruct, but I very
much question whether he will
satisfy, the reader. When Goguet
and Gibbon wrote, the subject
was much less understood
than it is at present.</p>

Another method of dyeing purple
prevailed in a district of Asia
Minor, where the quality of the
springs would appear to have
fixed the colour: “The waters
of Hierapolis were surprisingly
attempered for tinging wool

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1417'>1417</a>. Strabo relates an excellent
anecdote in illustration of this
passion of his countrymen. Speaking
of the city of Iasos, situated
in an island of the same name
on the coast of Caria, whose
inhabitants drew their chief subsistence
from their maritime pursuits,
and were abundantly supplied
with fish, he adds,—that
once upon a time a celebrated
musician was performing in public
before the inhabitants of this
city: suddenly the bell which
announced the opening of the
fish-market was heard to sound.
Away, in an instant, scampered
the Iasians, eager to secure their
favourite dainty, all except a
single individual, who appeared
to enjoy the performance of the
citharador. Flattered by this
mark of his taste or politeness,
the musician approached the man,
and said, “I am greatly obliged
by the attention you have
shown me, and have to congratulate
you on your love of
the art; for all the rest, as
soon as they heard the bell
ring, ran away.”—“What
then! has the bell rung?” inquired
the apparent listener, who
happened to be deaf. “Yes,”
answered the musician. “Then
good luck be with you!” cried
the man, and rising hastily from
his seat, he rushed after his
townsmen. Strab. xiv. 2. t. iii.

<div class='footnote' id='f1418'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r1418'>1418</a>. The observations made by
Spallanzani on the eel and lamprey
fisheries of Stromboli, may, with
equal propriety perhaps, be applied
to those which are found along
the roots of Ætna: “The fish
here,” he says, “are very plentiful
and large, especially the
sea-eels and murænas; and,
during my short stay in this
island, I saw a greater quantity
taken than during the whole
time of my continuance in all
the Eolian isles. They are,
likewise, of an excellent taste.
This abundance, I am inclined
to attribute to the volcano,
which has continued incessantly
burning from time immemorial;
and which, extending to an immense
depth, must necessarily
communicate a part of its heat
to the submarine base of the
mountain, and to the waters
that surround it, in the gentle
warmth of which the fish find
a more agreeable place of resort,
and perhaps propagate in
greater numbers than elsewhere.”

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1435'>1435</a>. Chandler supplies us with a
picture of this kind of fishing as
carried on in modern Greece:
“We embarked with a rougher
sea than was pleasing, and
rowed out in the dark towards
the island, intending to fish.
We joined our two seines, and
the boats parted, moving each
a different way, a man letting
the net gently down into the
water. We met again in the
centre, when some embers which
had been hidden, were blown
up and exposed on an iron
grate, the flame was fed with
cedar dipped in oil, which blazing
in the wind, brightened
over the deep; the red coals
hissing as they fell, and were
extinguished. At the same
time we began to clatter with
wooden hammers on the sides
and seats of the wherries, to
dash with a pole, and to throw
stones, disturbing and driving
the fish, and darting a trident
or spear if any appeared at the
top, dazzled by the light;
sprinkling oil to render the surface
tranquil and pellucid. The
men drew up the net with caution,
fearing the fins of some
poisonous fish, particularly the
scorpion, which is killed with a
blow on the head while entangled,
when the danger ceases.
The boats meeting again, they
untie the seines, and throwing
the fiery brands into the sea,
proceed in the dark to some
other place. This is the common
method of fishing in these
seas.” Travels in Greece and
Asia Minor, ii. p. 198, seq.</p>

They who act as sentinels in the
catching of the sword-fish, take
their station on a platform in
the fishing boat itself. “In the
middle (of the bark) is fixed an
upright pole, seventeen feet
high, with ladders to go up it,
and a kind of round platform
at the top, for one of the crew,
who acts as sentinel, to stand
on. This platform is called <em>fariere</em>.”

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1442'>1442</a>. Similar methods still prevail
in the Mediterranean. “We
had,” says Chandler, “frequent
opportunities (while at Genoa)
of seeing the method of fishing
within the mole. Several seines
are united and extended so far
as to form a large semicircle,
but much curved at the two
extremities. The men then retire
to some distance, and begin
clattering with sticks or hammers
on the sides of their
boats; the noise making the
fish rise. One stationed on the
yard-arm of a ship, takes notice
which way they swim,
and gives directions, until they
are within the net, when they
are driven towards the ends,
and are soon entangled; or,
trying from despair to leap
over, fall on a wing, which is
fastened to long reeds, and kept
floating horizontally on the surface.
The reward of much toil
was, now and then a few mullet.
The thynnus, or thunny
fish, was anciently and is now
taken nearly in this manner,
but in shoals which endanger
and often break the nets.”

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1445'>1445</a>. Observations made on the
habits of the swordfish may be
thought to give some colour to
this relation of the ancient naturalists:
“The swordfish, we
are told, is taken by the Messinese
sailors in two ways;
that is, with the lance, and
the palimadara, a kind of net
with very close meshes. This
fishery begins about the middle
of April, and continues till the
middle of September. From
the middle of April to the end
of June it is carried on upon
the coast of Calabria; and from
the end of June to the middle
of September on that of Sicily.
The reason of this is, that, by
the account of all the fishermen,
the swordfish, from April till
June, entering by Faro, coasts
the shore of Calabria, without
approaching that of Sicily;
and passes the contrary way
from the end of July to the
middle of September. We
know not whether it takes this
contrary route for the sake of
food, or from any other cause;
or whether it be the same fish
that passes and repasses; it
is only certain that it does not
coast the shore of Sicily but
when it goes to spawn.” Spallanzani,

  <h3 id='ch6.8' class='c012'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> COMMERCE OF DORIC STATES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>On the commerce of Greece, which would supply
materials for an interesting work, it is not my design
to enter into very numerous details, though
a brief view of the subject belongs to this undertaking.
The blessings of commerce are well understood
in our times, and the grand scale upon
which it is now conducted may perhaps induce some
to look back with something like contempt on its
feeble beginnings in the Mediterranean.<a id='r1465' /><a href='#f1465' class='c014'><sup>[1465]</sup></a> There, however,
lay the centre of that circle which has gone
on increasing until it at length embraces the whole
world, and almost renders the most distant races
necessary to each other. It must be interesting,
therefore, to look</p>

      <div class='line'>“O’er the dark backward and abysm of time,”</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>at the first movements of men towards forging the
links of this chain which binds together the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>human race in one society, disturbed sometimes by
evil passions, but cohering nevertheless, and apparently
becoming more interfused daily.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this movement there were, doubtless, several nations
that preceded the Greeks. The civilisation of
the East existing anterior to that of Greece, it was
the Orientals who made the first step towards opening
up that intercourse which afterwards became so
intimate between the inhabitants of Hellas and the
Arabs of Ph&oelig;nicia, the Egyptians, the Persians,
and other nations of the East. At first, indeed,
the camel,<a id='r1466' /><a href='#f1466' class='c014'><sup>[1466]</sup></a> that important instrument of human
improvement, revealed to the rude tribes bordering
on Arabia, the existence of wants within them,
of which they before knew nothing. He came with
sweets and luxuries on his back to the hamlet or
the encampment, and by the sight of them created
desires, to gratify which the aid of industry was to
be called in. At a very early age strings of camels,
laden with perfumes and spices, and gold, traversed
the plains of western Asia, ascended and descended
along the Nile, penetrated the northern coasts of
Africa, and, by barter and traffic, diffused the productions
of the East much further even than their own
footsteps reached, as now the manufactures of England
find their way into the countries never beheld
by an Englishman.</p>

<p class='c001'>Presently the blue and beautiful waters of the
Mediterranean tempted the adventurous Arabs who
had settled in Ph&oelig;nicia, the country of the palm-tree,
to launch their barks on it, and push from
isle to isle till they found themselves in Hellas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>where the beauty of the women occasionally, perhaps,
when they were not to be enticed away, may
have tempted an adventurer<a id='r1467' /><a href='#f1467' class='c014'><sup>[1467]</sup></a> to remain as other
Arabs have done in every land whither they have
wandered.<a id='r1468' /><a href='#f1468' class='c014'><sup>[1468]</sup></a> This, I am persuaded, is all that can
be conceded to those who see so many proofs of
Oriental colonies in Greece. But though the Orientals
did not colonize Greece, they no doubt aided
very powerfully in civilizing it. For when the rude
natives saw that there were many desirable things
to be obtained from the strangers if they could
give them any thing valuable in return, it must
have set their wits at work to invent new means
of obtaining the things they coveted. At the outset
it was a rough system of barter. The Phœnicians
took the produce of the country in exchange
for their merchandise, and secured their own success
by awakening an appetite for pleasures which
they alone could furnish.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, tradition has preserved evident traces of
voyages of discovery and commercial adventure undertaken
by the Greeks<a id='r1469' /><a href='#f1469' class='c014'><sup>[1469]</sup></a> themselves, in imitation of
the Phœnicians,—for, into this the Argonautic expedition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>in what direction soever it proceeded, resolves
itself, in fact. The Greeks possessed manufactures,
ships, commerce, and, as a consequence,
considerable wealth, long before the birth of history,
a circumstance which goes far to overthrow the wild
theories of certain modern scholars respecting the
Iliad and Odyssey; for, if the Greeks had constant
dealings with nations who were indisputably in possession
of the art of writing, with abundant materials,
they must have been the slowest and most stupid
of mankind if they neglected to imitate those nations.
Besides, the Ph&oelig;nicians would be as ready to supply
them with paper, parchment, and whatever else they
wrote on, as with any other articles of commerce,
and must have desired to awaken in them the wish
to consume what they were deeply interested in
supplying. Thus, if the Ph&oelig;nicians and Egyptians
understood the art of writing, as from the sacred
Scriptures we know they did, it is all but impossible
that the Greeks should have remained ignorant
of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Homer, of course, supplies the best account we
can possess of Grecian commerce in remote antiquity,
though it had been carried on ages before his time.
Mariners, in the Odyssey, obtain the name of πρηκτῆρες,
or “merchants,” and are elsewhere said to
plough the seas, ἐπὶ πρῆξιν καὶ χρήματα,—“for traffic
and gain.”<a id='r1470' /><a href='#f1470' class='c014'><sup>[1470]</sup></a> The most celebrated mariners known to
Homer were the Ph&oelig;nicians, whom he therefore terms,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>That from the beginning, moreover, they obtained
celebrity for their piratical arts, the story of Eunæos,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>in the Odyssey, and the rape of Io, as related by
Herodotus,<a id='r1472' /><a href='#f1472' class='c014'><sup>[1472]</sup></a> clearly show. Nay, Thucydides himself,
in a recapitulation of the ancient history of Greece,
observes that the islanders, chiefly Carians and Ph&oelig;nicians,
were no less renowned than their neighbours
for piracy.<a id='r1473' /><a href='#f1473' class='c014'><sup>[1473]</sup></a> The Ph&oelig;nicians, however, would appear
to have led the way, and, probably, by their successes
excited the emulation of the Carians, who drove them
from the island, and adopted the business of piracy
in their stead.<a id='r1474' /><a href='#f1474' class='c014'><sup>[1474]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Though the value of the precious metals was
already well understood, they had not been adopted
as the sole instruments of exchange; for, from the
often-cited passage of the Iliad,<a id='r1475' /><a href='#f1475' class='c014'><sup>[1475]</sup></a> it is clear that the
practice of barter still prevailed. The poet describes
certain ships arriving at the Grecian camp with a
cargo of wine from Lemnos, on which the chiefs and
soldiers flock to the shore, and provide themselves
with what they needed, some giving in exchange
for it a quantity of brass, iron, skins; and others, oxen
or slaves. Among the rustic population of Greece,
if the poets may be relied on, the system of barter
prevailed down to a very late period, since we find
the goatherd, in Theocritus,<a id='r1476' /><a href='#f1476' class='c014'><sup>[1476]</sup></a> giving a she-goat and
a cheesecake for a pastoral cup. The Spartans, too,
after the death of Polydoros, purchased his palace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>from the widow for a certain number of oxen; whence
it was afterwards called βοώνητα,<a id='r1477' /><a href='#f1477' class='c014'><sup>[1477]</sup></a> or “bought with
oxen,” unless the legend was invented to account
for the name. Pausanias, however, states as a reason
for the transaction, that neither gold nor silver money
was yet in use, but that things were disposed of
after the ancient fashion of exchanging goods for
their value in some other article,—oxen, slaves, or
gold or silver in ingots. He adds, in illustration,
that the Indians, even in his age, were ignorant of
the use of money, though abounding with the precious
metals, and used to barter their own manufactures
for the merchandise brought by the Greeks: besides,
at Sparta, there was a law, attributed to Lycurgos,
which prescribed barter in lieu of purchase and sale.<a id='r1478' /><a href='#f1478' class='c014'><sup>[1478]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From a passage in the Iliad, which would seem
to signify the direct contrary, it has been inferred,
that the use of money in commerce was known
among the Greeks in the Homeric age. Speaking
of the exchange of armour, between Glaucos and
Diomedes, the poet says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>Gold armour for brazen, a hundred-ox value for nine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>An ancient scholiast on the passage understands
by βοῦς a piece of money, stamped on one side
with the figure of an ox, and on the other with
that of a king.<a id='r1480' /><a href='#f1480' class='c014'><sup>[1480]</sup></a> But one of the scholia published
by Villoison, observes on the word <a id='corr250.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ἐκατόμβοιαν'>ἑκατόμβοια</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_250.28'><ins class='correction' title='ἐκατόμβοιαν'>ἑκατόμβοια</ins></a></span>,
“worth a hundred oxen, for they did not as yet
make use of money.” Another scholion,<a id='r1481' /><a href='#f1481' class='c014'><sup>[1481]</sup></a> however,
remarks, οἱ γὰρ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐν τοῖς ἐαυτῶν νομίσμασι
βοῦν ἐνετύπουν. Pollux<a id='r1482' /><a href='#f1482' class='c014'><sup>[1482]</sup></a> relates the same fact, observing
that, in remote antiquity, the Athenians
made use of a piece of money called βοῦς, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>it had impressed upon it the figure of an ox, and
that, by many, Homer was supposed to have alluded
to this Attic coin in the verse above cited,
“indocte,” however, as Heyne<a id='r1483' /><a href='#f1483' class='c014'><sup>[1483]</sup></a> observes. Mention
of a fine called δεκάβοιον occurred, according to Pollux,
in the laws of Dracon; and in the procession
(θεωρία) to Delos, the herald used to proclaim when
a certain prize was given, that so many oxen were
bestowed on such a one. The value of the coin
was two didrachmæ, so that the Bous was simply
a <em>didrachma</em>.<a id='r1484' /><a href='#f1484' class='c014'><sup>[1484]</sup></a> The ox was stamped by the Athenians
on their coins as the symbol of peace and
abundance.<a id='r1485' /><a href='#f1485' class='c014'><sup>[1485]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Plutarch<a id='r1486' /><a href='#f1486' class='c014'><sup>[1486]</sup></a> assigns, by conjecture, two reasons;
first, that Theseus, whom he regards as its inventor,
may have meant by the figure of the ox
to recall the memory of Minos’s general Tauros; or,
second, because he wished to turn the mind of the
citizens to agriculture.</p>

<p class='c001'>The talent of gold is mentioned more than once
by Homer;<a id='r1487' /><a href='#f1487' class='c014'><sup>[1487]</sup></a> but we are not to imagine with
Feith<a id='r1488' /><a href='#f1488' class='c014'><sup>[1488]</sup></a> that there was a piece of money so called,
though in the case of Homer he supposes it to
signify a certain weight of gold, and not a coin.
Modern critics get over all difficulties in the usual
way by pronouncing the passage spurious.<a id='r1489' /><a href='#f1489' class='c014'><sup>[1489]</sup></a> No
doubt the people of those early times did not
greatly abound in wealth, which, arising from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>assiduous cultivation of the useful arts, could not
be plentiful where these arts were scarcely at all
known. Even tyrants, who always contrive to obtain
their share of whatever riches exist in their
country, were long after the Homeric age possessed
of but little wealth, any more than their people.<a id='r1490' /><a href='#f1490' class='c014'><sup>[1490]</sup></a>
Money, however, does not constitute opulence.
There was a rude plenty of all the necessaries of
life, and as the secret representative of wealth
had not been invented, men sought to possess the
realities,—herds of oxen, flocks of sheep, lands,
houses, and splendid apparel. Fine studs of horses,
also, were naturally desired, being at once useful in
war, and showy in peace.<a id='r1491' /><a href='#f1491' class='c014'><sup>[1491]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We observe in these ages, however, as well as
in all others, that men no sooner enjoyed the necessaries
than they desired the luxuries and ornaments
of life. In several countries bordering upon
the Mediterranean, there was already great magnificence
displayed. The kings of Midian, for example,
wore purple garments, golden earrings, and
jewelled collars; their camels, moreover, were covered
with costly trimmings and ornaments of gold.<a id='r1492' /><a href='#f1492' class='c014'><sup>[1492]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of the internal commerce of Greece, in the earlier
ages, little, comparatively, is known. Goguet<a id='r1493' /><a href='#f1493' class='c014'><sup>[1493]</sup></a> appears
to suppose, that hardly any traffic can be carried
on without the aid of sumpter animals, such as
camels, mules, or asses. But the natives of Canara<a id='r1494' /><a href='#f1494' class='c014'><sup>[1494]</sup></a>
drive a pretty thriving trade, though nearly every
article of merchandise is transported on men’s heads.
In Greece, however, the use of vehicles was very
ancient, its origin being lost in fable.<a id='r1495' /><a href='#f1495' class='c014'><sup>[1495]</sup></a> Boats, canoes,
&amp;c., came early into vogue also; and yet Thucydides
relates, that the intercourse of the rural
tribes of the Hellenes was for many ages so slight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>as scarcely to merit attention. Bad roads, the absence
of inns, the want of a police, the great number
of robbers, were great obstacles; but the very
existence of robbers attests the fact, that attempts
were constantly made to extend inland commerce,
though it may have been long before it was established
on a solid basis.</p>

<p class='c001'>Descending towards the historical periods we find
the Æginetans first distinguishing themselves as a
commercial people. Their history, as far as ancient
fragments supply it, has been composed by a modern
scholar<a id='r1496' /><a href='#f1496' class='c014'><sup>[1496]</sup></a> of eminence, whose researches must
prove of the utmost utility to all succeeding inquirers.
This people, living on a small and nearly
barren island, early directed their attention to the
arts, to the various processes of industry, and to
commerce, the only employment suited to the nature
of their soil. Too much stress has, perhaps,
been laid on the situation of Ægina, which will not
at all explain the commercial turn of its inhabitants,
since Crete, with more abundant means, and
possibly a better situation, was never very remarkable
as a trading country. However, poverty and a good
position combined with the genius of the people to
render them commercial. They enjoyed still fewer
advantages in the matter of soil even than Attica;
their lands were of little value; they could neither
become hunters nor shepherds; nor could even the
most slender population subsist on the produce of
the mines. Fishing they, probably, tried at the outset,
as well as piracy, but, finding that neither led
to opulence, they adopted the mercantile life; for
which reason they have, with much ingenuity, been
termed the Phœnicians of Greece,<a id='r1497' /><a href='#f1497' class='c014'><sup>[1497]</sup></a> though no colonies
from Phœnicia ever settled in their island.
The Æginetæ were already famous, however, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>remote antiquity, as mariners, and, in the course of
time, converted their whole island into an emporium.<a id='r1498' /><a href='#f1498' class='c014'><sup>[1498]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the antiquity of the Æginetan trade a very
curious passage occurs in Pausanias. This writer
relates, that, in the time of Pompos, king of Arcadia,
who flourished during the second century before
the first Olympiad, Æginetan ships landed at
Cyllenè, the great harbour of Elis, whence they
transported their merchandise, on strings of sumpter
animals, to Arcadia. The king was so much pleased
with them on this account, that he named his son
Æginetes, in remembrance of their traffic.<a id='r1499' /><a href='#f1499' class='c014'><sup>[1499]</sup></a> It was
about this period that the Greeks first began to
trade in their own bottoms, and to possess merchandise
of their own. It has been observed, that
in Homer the word ἔμπορος never signifies merchant,
and that where mention of real merchants occurs
they are always barbarians, or semi-barbarians,<a id='r1500' /><a href='#f1500' class='c014'><sup>[1500]</sup></a>
Phœnicians, Cretans, Tyrsenians, Lemnians, Taphians,
or Phæacians.<a id='r1501' /><a href='#f1501' class='c014'><sup>[1501]</sup></a> No Achaian or Argive is found who
derived his subsistence from commerce, though
there seem to be passages from which the contrary
may be inferred. But in Hesiod, who lived
later, and describes more homely scenes and manners,
we find commerce already spoken of as a
profitable employment.<a id='r1502' /><a href='#f1502' class='c014'><sup>[1502]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Originally, the Æginetans were led by their piratical
propensities to apply themselves to maritime
affairs; finding, no doubt, that robbery was an easier
and more agreeable profession than any modification
of industry, particularly as in those tolerant ages
there was no disgrace, but the contrary, attached
to it, when exercised against men of a different
class. These worthy islanders, however, were impartial
in their rapine. For, no sooner had they
thrown off the yoke of the Epidaurians, than they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>made incursions<a id='r1503' /><a href='#f1503' class='c014'><sup>[1503]</sup></a> into their mother country, which
they soon extended to the coasts of Attica; and
they were, probably, the buccaneers against whom
the tyrant Hippias fitted out a fleet.<a id='r1504' /><a href='#f1504' class='c014'><sup>[1504]</sup></a> Afterwards,
forming an alliance with the Thebans, they plundered
and devastated all the maritime towns of Attica,
and even lay in ambush to intercept the
sacred galley on its way to Delos.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having been restored to their country, after the
Peloponnesian war, they resumed their plundering
habits, and obtained from the Spartan Ephori permission
to infest the Attic coasts, which they frequently
did in times of profound peace. Their taste
for piracy was lasting. In the age of Demosthenes
their island was a nest of pirates, and a fair for the
sale of their plunder, which it continued for many
centuries after.<a id='r1505' /><a href='#f1505' class='c014'><sup>[1505]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Reverting, however, to the trade of Ægina: its
ancient traffic with Arcadia was marked by many
curious circumstances. In the first place we must
infer from it, as the historian of the island remarks,
the existence of previous traffic elsewhere.<a id='r1506' /><a href='#f1506' class='c014'><sup>[1506]</sup></a> For, if
their merchandise consisted merely of raw materials,
these must still have been procured from other
lands; and, if of manufactured goods, then, in addition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>to the existence of a foreign trade to supply
them with the raw articles, we must suppose in
them the existence of considerable skill. Again,
as Pompos, the Cypselid, probably reigned at Orchomenos,
they must have been able to perform
long voyages by sea, and long journeys by land;
though we can account for their taking the dangerous
route round capes Skylleion and Malea, and
the mountainous roads from Eleia to Arcadia, in
preference to the shorter way from Corinthia or Argolis,
only by supposing them to have been driven
to it by the rivalry of the Argives and Corinthians.
It must be admitted to be honourable to their ingenuity
thus to have opened up a road into Arcadia,
which would seem to be shut out by nature from
all commerce.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the Arcadians alone, however, could inland
trade be carried on upon a large scale; among every
other Hellenic people possessing sea-coasts and harbours,
it degenerated into mere peddling. Hence,
the Æginetans obtained the character, once possessed
in this country by the Scotch, of being a
nation of pedlars—sometimes travelling from village
to village, with their packs; at other times
settling, like the Maltese of the present day, in
towns on the coast of Greece, they became corn-chandlers,
vintners, toymen, or victuallers, in established
shops or stalls in the agora. Hence, all
kinds of humble wares, or pedlary, obtained the
appellation of Æginetan wares. Like the Jews,
too, both they and the Cretans (noted liars, as St.
Paul<a id='r1507' /><a href='#f1507' class='c014'><sup>[1507]</sup></a> assures us) were regarded as skin-flints, and,
in many cases, betook themselves to the practice
of usury.<a id='r1508' /><a href='#f1508' class='c014'><sup>[1508]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Frequently, however, they soared above these
petty arts, and became merchants on a large scale,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>trading with distant lands and acquiring very great
wealth. The entire island, in Strabo’s time, was
regarded as an emporium; and, even so far back as
the age of Aristotle, their whole marine was employed
in commerce. In some cities, he says, nearly
all the shipping is engaged in one kind of service;
those of Byzantium and Tarentum in the fisheries;
those of Athens in war; those of Chios and Ægina
as merchantmen; and those of Tenedos as transports.<a id='r1509' /><a href='#f1509' class='c014'><sup>[1509]</sup></a>
It has been conjectured, not without reason,
that Sostratos, the son of Leodamos, celebrated
by Herodotus for his riches, was a merchant. “The
Samians,” says this historian, “induced by divine
command to undertake the voyage of Tartessos,
brought home with them greater wealth (sixty
talents) than any other Greeks ever gained by
trade, if we except Sostratos, with whom no one
can contend in opulence.<a id='r1510' /><a href='#f1510' class='c014'><sup>[1510]</sup></a>”</p>

<p class='c001'>But the Æginetans also engaged in foreign trade,
sending ships to Tartessos towards the west, and to
the Black Sea towards the east. It is related, for
example, that when Xerxes was at Abydos, he saw
merchantmen sailing down the Dardanelles with corn
for Ægina and the Peloponnesos,<a id='r1511' /><a href='#f1511' class='c014'><sup>[1511]</sup></a> which were stopped
by his fleet with the design of taking both ships and
men. But when Xerxes learned they were bound
for Greece, he dismissed them, considering the corn
as so much provision for his own army, which, he
doubted not, would be able to subjugate the whole
country. From which Müller conjectures, but without
reason, that the great corn markets of the Black
Sea were at that time exclusively in the hands of the
Æginetans; though afterwards, during the Peloponnesian
war, when Ægina fell, they passed over to the
Athenians. The reason “that the Æginetans stood so
much in need of the supply, that they would not have
endured a rival,” could only hold good if they had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>power to command a monopoly, which, for any length
of time at least, is highly improbable, since although
they are said to have been masters of the sea about the
age of Darius Hystaspes,<a id='r1512' /><a href='#f1512' class='c014'><sup>[1512]</sup></a> their domination was extremely
short-lived.<a id='r1513' /><a href='#f1513' class='c014'><sup>[1513]</sup></a> It would seem, however, that they
were at that time in the habit of supplying the Peloponnesos
with grain. Slaves they imported both from
Pontos and from Crete, and it is doubtful whence
they obtained the greater number. A large proportion
of their exports found their way into Crete,
where they had established a colony at Cydonia.
Besides lying one day’s sail distant from the Peloponnesos,
and that of a day and a night from Africa,
this great island formed an excellent midway station
between Ægina and the mouth of the Nile.</p>

<p class='c001'>The port at which all the Greeks resided during
their stay in Egypt was Naucratis in the Delta,
which the Pharaohs granted them in the same way
as the Chinese emperors now do Canton to the
Europeans, as their only abode. Here, by permission
of Amasis, such Greeks as merely traded with Egypt
built altars and erected sacred enclosures in the
neighbourhood of the city, though I vainly sought,
when on the spot, to discover the slightest trace of
them. The nine cities of Ionians, Dorians, and
Æolians erected at their common expense a sacred
edifice, which they called Hellenion. The Ionian
cities were Chios, Teos, Phocea and Clazomenæ; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Dorian, Rhodes, Cnidos, Halicarnassos, and Phaselis;
of the Æolian, Mitylene only. The Æginetans
raised for their own use a temple to Zeus,—the
Samians to Hera,—the Milesians to Apollo.<a id='r1514' /><a href='#f1514' class='c014'><sup>[1514]</sup></a> At this
time, however, Naucratis was the only harbour in
Egypt; and as this was pretty generally known,
ships making land anywhere else were naturally suspected
of being pirates; for which reason the captain
was required to swear that he had come hither
involuntarily. This done, he was to steer from the
Canopic mouth of the Nile; or, if the weather were
contrary, his cargo was conveyed round the Delta
in barides to Naucratis, which the historian<a id='r1515' /><a href='#f1515' class='c014'><sup>[1515]</sup></a> understood
to be done for the benefit of the foreign settlers,
for so greatly, says he, was Naucratis honoured.
At this time, one of the principal articles exported
into Egypt by the Greeks would appear to
have been wine, since all then drunk in the country
was foreign, the vine not having been as yet introduced.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the trade of Sparta extremely little is known.
In fact, until a comparatively late period, it appears to
have been inconsiderable, and to have been conducted
in the rudest manner possible. Each citizen, on
receiving the proceeds of his lands, laid up in his
storehouses what he judged sufficient for the consumption
of the ensuing year, and disposed of the remainder
in the Agora, not, it has been conjectured, for
money, but by the ancient manner of barter.<a id='r1516' /><a href='#f1516' class='c014'><sup>[1516]</sup></a> It
is said that the Lacedæmonians exhibited much ingenuity
in their mode of preserving the fruits of the
earth; but in what that ingenuity consisted we are
not informed. They were likewise noted for the
care and order with which the implements of domestic
economy were kept, so that everything was ready
at hand when wanted.<a id='r1517' /><a href='#f1517' class='c014'><sup>[1517]</sup></a> The fact that they had granaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>on their estates, which were locked up and sealed,
argues much greater connexion with the country,
than they are supposed to have maintained; for had
they never lived on those estates, it is not probable
they would have left their property there, subject,
as Mr. Müller<a id='r1518' /><a href='#f1518' class='c014'><sup>[1518]</sup></a> thinks, to the conscientious visits of
every poor man who might choose to out-hunt his
provisions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Money, we are incessantly told, was prohibited
at Sparta; but, nevertheless, it seems to have been
in constant use. It is affirmed, indeed, by a writer
somewhat too prone to panegyric, that “it was employed
more often as a medium of comparison than
of exchange; small coins were chiefly used, and no
value was attributed to the possession of large quantities.”<a id='r1519' /><a href='#f1519' class='c014'><sup>[1519]</sup></a>
But I do not see what is meant by employing
money “as a medium of comparison;” and
with regard to the value set on money by the
Spartans, history incapacitates us for accepting the
generous gloss of Mr. Müller. It is perhaps true
that Lycurgos aimed at eradicating avarice from
the Spartan breast, but, in the means to be adopted
for that end, only showed his ignorance of human
nature; since, though he might bring his vinegar-cooled
iron medium of comparison into contempt, he
could not thereby diminish the value of the things
exchanged, that is of real wealth, which accordingly
was estimated as highly at Sparta as elsewhere.
Thus we see that poor men, not able to contribute
their quota of provisions, were excluded from the
common tables, which therefore resembled the hospitality
and common tables of an inn,<a id='r1520' /><a href='#f1520' class='c014'><sup>[1520]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>The learned, with all their leaning towards scepticism,
sometimes interpret too literally the language
of authors in whom license and exaggeration are a
merit. Thus Bœckh<a id='r1521' /><a href='#f1521' class='c014'><sup>[1521]</sup></a> conceives “that, even in the
time of the Trojan war, the precious metals were
well known in the Peloponnesos,” because Homer
describes Menelaus as possessed of both gold and
silver.<a id='r1522' /><a href='#f1522' class='c014'><sup>[1522]</sup></a> But the Achæan prince had travelled in
the East, whence, according to the poet, he brought
his gold, and it does not appear historically that
the precious metals were “well known,” which extensive
use only could render them, till some ages
after the Trojan war. The Dorians, however, whatever
may have been the case with the Achæans,
long continued to be scantily supplied with the
precious metals, which may be accounted for from
their isolated mountainous country, want of industry,
and aversion for all intercourse with strangers,
without adopting the unphilosophical fancy, that they
were instigated by a kind of argyrophobia strictly
to prohibit the use of gold and silver.<a id='r1523' /><a href='#f1523' class='c014'><sup>[1523]</sup></a> Conceiving
that, by cutting his people off from human intercourse,
he might render them more warlike, as dogs
are made savage by chaining, Lycurgos, or whoever
was the author of the Spartan constitution,
may have desired to keep them poor, and therefore
have prohibited commerce. But even in their own
domestic traffic, the necessity of some instrument
of exchange was soon perceived, and iron<a id='r1524' /><a href='#f1524' class='c014'><sup>[1524]</sup></a> being
as plentiful as gold and silver were scarce, he
adopted the expedient of employing iron money.
At first the metal was used in bars or spits (ὀβελοὶ,
ὀβελίσκοι) which were stamped with some mark in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the furnaces of Laconia, just as in other countries
bars of silver or copper were used; “whence the
obolos or <em>spit</em> and the drachma or <em>handful</em> received
their names.”<a id='r1525' /><a href='#f1525' class='c014'><sup>[1525]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When the Argives, in the reign of Pheidon,
abandoned the use of metallic bars, and began to
coin money, the Spartans followed in their train,
but still adhered to the use of iron, so that the
coins which first proceeded from a Laconian mint,
probably resembled quoits more than crown-pieces.
Mr. Müller observes, but I know not on what authority,
that the chief coin was called from its <em>shape</em>,
and perhaps also from its <em>size</em>, πέλανορ, the cake
used in sacrifices. If this was the case it must
have been a coin of extraordinary conformation, for
the <em>pelanos</em> resembled, in figure, a bull, horns and
all,<a id='r1526' /><a href='#f1526' class='c014'><sup>[1526]</sup></a> and was habitually offered to Apollo, Artemis,
the Moon, and Hecatè. This odd-looking piece of
money was in value about four chalci or hemioboloi,
that is, about three farthings. But such an unwieldy
coinage, which, as tokens, might serve very
well for the home currency, would be of no service
abroad; so that when Sparta began to aim
at foreign conquest, it found it necessary to set
aside the ancient laws, and create a currency for
effecting its purpose. A tribute was therefore imposed
on the islands, and a contribution of a tenth
was demanded from all those Greeks who acknowledged
its supremacy.<a id='r1527' /><a href='#f1527' class='c014'><sup>[1527]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It seems, however, to have been intended by the
legislator, that individuals should not possess gold
and silver money; but the severity of the punishment<a id='r1528' /><a href='#f1528' class='c014'><sup>[1528]</sup></a>
awarded transgressors, instead of proving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>how strong the hold of this ancient custom (of
being without money) was upon the Spartan mind,
shows the direct contrary, for there is no necessity
to be severe with men who obey from habit,
but with those who evince a disposition to break
through all restraint. Besides, the law seems to
have permitted the use of the precious metals
when wrought into ornaments or articles of furniture.
Offerings of gold, such as the stars of the
Dioscuri, were dedicated by the state at Delphi,
and statues of gold and ivory, the works of native
artists, were set up within the city about the period
of the Persian war.<a id='r1529' /><a href='#f1529' class='c014'><sup>[1529]</sup></a> A hundred years earlier,
when the state desired to gild the face of
Apollo, at Thornax, they travelled as far as Lydia<a id='r1530' /><a href='#f1530' class='c014'><sup>[1530]</sup></a>
in search of the necessary gold, which wholly
disproves the assumption of Bœckh mentioned
above.</p>

<p class='c001'>But after all the learned researches of modern
writers, this Spartan ordinance respecting the possession
of money is surrounded by insurmountable
difficulties. For Sparta, unquestionably, carried on
some commerce, which it could not have done
without possessing a coinage of universal currency;
though Mr. Müller is not authorized to state, as
he does, that there was a constant export of corn
from Laconia and Arcadia downwards to the coast
of Corinth, since the passage in Thucydides,<a id='r1531' /><a href='#f1531' class='c014'><sup>[1531]</sup></a> on
which he relies, merely relates in the words of the
Corinthians, that unless they joined in the war
against Athens in aid of the maritime states, they
would find no market for the produce of their
lands, (including corn, no doubt,) nor would they
be able to import what they might stand in need
of from abroad.<a id='r1532' /><a href='#f1532' class='c014'><sup>[1532]</sup></a> However, so far back as the
Persian war, the Peloponnesos did not produce
corn sufficient for home consumption, since we find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>it importing it from the countries of the Black Sea.
It is, therefore, extremely improbable that it should
have done so in the time of the Peloponnesian war,
when it had grown far more populous, so that possibly
among the things which ἡ θάλασση τῇ ἠπείρῳ
δίδωσι corn may have been included.</p>

<p class='c001'>It appears, therefore, that Sparta both exported
and imported; but who were the agents? The
state, which alone it is supposed possessed an
available instrument of exchange, could not, it is
argued, have carried on the trade. But wherefore?
“Because it would have required a proportionate
number of public officers.”<a id='r1533' /><a href='#f1533' class='c014'><sup>[1533]</sup></a> Those
officers, however, might easily have been found,
and, therefore, this is no reason; and that no such
officers existed, our knowledge of the government
is too scanty to enable us to affirm. Accordingly,
it does not follow from this that the trade “was
in the hands of the Periœci.” However, if such
was the case, the possession of a gold and silver
coinage must have been permitted to them, which
at once places the great majority of the free
inhabitants of Laconia in precisely the same condition
as other nations in this respect. Admitting
this, it will be difficult to believe that their neighbours
and acquaintances, the military and ruling
class, would abstain from what they enjoyed. In
fact, we cannot consent to believe, that such a
state of things “could not have had much influence
on the Spartans, since they had not any personal
connexion with the Periœci, the latter being only
tributary to the state.” The reverse of all this is
true, as any one might know without any other
testimony than his own experience. Our countrymen
in India occupy the same position as the Dorians
in the Peloponnesos, and for a short time
kept much aloof from the natives. But personal
intercourse became inevitable, and it would now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>be absurd to say, that the wealth of the Hindûs
would exercise little influence on the English, supposing
the latter to be poor and proud as the
Spartans. The fact of the Periœci being tributary,
which seems to be offered as a reason, is no reason
at all. It were far better to confess our ignorance
at once, than by a series of groundless conjectures,
put forward with confidence, to create a semblance
of knowledge. There does not appear to be any
foundation for the statement, that none but iron
money was used in the Spartan market, where the
landlords and their serfs disposed of the produce of
their lands. On the contrary, it seems probable,
that as, in many cases, it must have been sold to
the Periœci for exportation, (foreigners being excluded,)
the landlords would receive gold and silver unminted,
perhaps, to evade the law in return. Again,
the kings of Sparta, it is evident, could possess
gold and silver. This, history proves so clearly that
Mr. Müller is constrained to confess it. And if the
kings and the Periœci, nay, even the very Helots
could amass and enjoy the precious metals, and the
luxuries they purchase, it is too much to suppose
that the masters of the kings, of the Periœci and
all, would have dwelt in ascetic forbearance in the
midst of so many temptations. Besides, we constantly
find the Spartans in situations in which
their iron money could be of no service to them.
What, for example, could it have availed them at
Olympia? Yet there they were, the men in person,
the women by proxy, with their horses and their
chariots, and every mark and indication of wealth.</p>

<p class='c001'>But to men travelling beyond the borders money
was allowed. This sum they might expend,
or they might not. If they did not, were they
searched on their return, and the surplus taken
from them? Otherwise men would make journeys
and accumulate cash in that way. Again, we
are told, that great obstacles were placed in the
way of foreign travel by the necessity of obtaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>a passport along with the travelling expenses (ἐφόδια)
from the magistrates or the king, and reference is
made to Herodotus. But that historian in the passage
referred to is speaking of king Demaratos, who
being driven from the country by his mother’s bad
character, takes what money he needs for his journey,
and departs without asking leave of any one.<a id='r1534' /><a href='#f1534' class='c014'><sup>[1534]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>However, when straitened in circumstances individuals
had sometimes recourse to the kings or
to the state as to a bank; and that the thing was
customary appears from the fact, that princes, in
order to start with a popular measure, always upon
their accession remitted the debts of the citizens
both to themselves and to the state.<a id='r1535' /><a href='#f1535' class='c014'><sup>[1535]</sup></a> On this occasion
they destroyed all the bonds or instruments
of mortgage (κλάρια), bringing them into the agora,
and there piling them up into a heap and setting
them on fire.<a id='r1536' /><a href='#f1536' class='c014'><sup>[1536]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is certain, therefore, and admitted even by
Mr. Müller, that whatever may have been the intention
of the original Spartan institutions, their
severity was soon relaxed, and wealth with all its
concomitants, introduced into the state. Even so
far back as the ages before the Persian war, as we
learn from the speech of Leutychides,<a id='r1537' /><a href='#f1537' class='c014'><sup>[1537]</sup></a> at Athens,
foreigners found no obstacle to prevent their bringing
gold and silver to Sparta, where one of the
most distinguished citizens undertook the keeping
of a rich Milesian’s money, whose children he afterwards
endeavoured to defraud. Could he have made
no use of this money he would scarcely have desired
to retain it. The share of the plunder accruing to
Sparta in the Persian war was evidently not confined
to the public coffers, though we may possibly
allow that the Persian subsidies went to the defraying
of national expenses.<a id='r1538' /><a href='#f1538' class='c014'><sup>[1538]</sup></a> At all events certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>it is that Sparta, about the time of Socrates,
was by many regarded as the wealthiest state in
Greece, and that not as a community, but individually,
reckoning their estates in Messenia, the
number of their slaves, Helots and others, their
splendid studs, and vast droves of cattle. Nay,
their wealth in gold and silver is particularly specified,
with the additional remark, that for many
ages the precious metals had been flowing into that
country, both from Grecian and barbarian sources,<a id='r1539' /><a href='#f1539' class='c014'><sup>[1539]</sup></a>
but that no one had ever seen any flow out, an
observation which Montesquieu,<a id='r1540' /><a href='#f1540' class='c014'><sup>[1540]</sup></a> and others have applied
without reflection, to Hindústân.</p>

<p class='c001'>It exceeds our faith in human nature to believe,
with Mr. Müller, that, in spite of these untoward
circumstances, “the citizens maintained the same
proud indigence.” History, in fact, renders inexcusable
the belief in such virtue, though men occasionally
arose at Sparta, as well as at Athens and
elsewhere, who, with a stoical firmness, resisted the
allurements of riches and pleasure. The greater
number fell, and yielded themselves up with so much
enthusiasm to the pursuit of gain, adding acre to acre
and gold to gold, that from the Ephoralty of Epitadeus
downwards, the city was infested with usurers, great
capitalists, and extensive landed proprietors, who, by
degrees, got into their hands the whole property of
the country. Much less ingenuity than the Spartans
possessed would, in fact, have enabled them
to evade the old law, which seems to have immediately
grown obsolete when the arts of rendering
it powerless had been invented. They deposited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>their surplus wealth at Delphi, in Arcadia,
and several other countries, so that if driven into
exile,<a id='r1541' /><a href='#f1541' class='c014'><sup>[1541]</sup></a> of which there was always a probability,
they might be able to subsist in splendour in their
new country.<a id='r1542' /><a href='#f1542' class='c014'><sup>[1542]</sup></a> But these speculations sometimes
failed; in the case of the Arcadians, the possession
of the gold converted bankers into enemies, as,
by picking a quarrel with the owners, they hoped
to be able to defraud them.<a id='r1543' /><a href='#f1543' class='c014'><sup>[1543]</sup></a> Lysander, though he
did not commence this practice, at least countenanced
it by his example. Gylippos, inheriting from his
family the thirst of gold, was condemned and starved
to death, by the Ephori, for purloining public
property. His father Cleandridas, in conjunction
with king Pleistoanax, had accepted bribes from Pericles,
and ended his days in exile.<a id='r1544' /><a href='#f1544' class='c014'><sup>[1544]</sup></a> From this
period, as seems to be undeniable, the possession
of gold and silver by private individuals was permitted
by law, or connived at; and the Spartans
proceeded, after the manner of all other nations,
to divide themselves into very rich and very poor,
to house together, in the same city, misery and
splendour, extreme luxury and extreme want, until
the common fate, foreign conquest and slavery,
overtook them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The trade which, meanwhile, was carried on by
Laconia must have been at times very considerable,
though there were few points on the coast provided
with roadsteads, or harbours, capable of receiving
ships of burden. To facilitate intercourse with
foreign nations, an artificial harbour was constructed
at Trinasos, around which the inhabitants of Gythium,
situated on an eminence some distance inland, gradually
clustered, deserting their ancient residence
for one more convenient and profitable. From hence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>the productions of Laconia, which will be enumerated
elsewhere, were shipped for foreign countries,
Libya for example, and Egypt, whence merchandise
of various kinds were obtained in return. But,
as this port appears to have been little commodious
or secure, the merchantmen, on their return from
Africa, usually put into the island of Cythera,<a id='r1545' /><a href='#f1545' class='c014'><sup>[1545]</sup></a> where
are several harbours, amongst which that of St. Nicholas,
anciently Scandeia,<a id='r1546' /><a href='#f1546' class='c014'><sup>[1546]</sup></a> on the eastern coast, is
sheltered and spacious, and provided with so narrow
an entrance that it may at pleasure be closed with
a chain. The inhabitants of this island, like those of
the Laconian territories on the main, were free Lacedæmonians,
who appear to have directed their attention
entirely to commerce and agriculture, and
the management of the productive purple fishery,
carried on among the shoals and rocks encircling
their island.<a id='r1547' /><a href='#f1547' class='c014'><sup>[1547]</sup></a> Besides its use in dyeing, this fish
is said to have been employed as a bait in taking
the pelamys, and there was, likewise, in this sea, a
considerable whale fishery. The nerves of these leviathans,
properly prepared, were used in stringing
the psaltery, and other musical instruments, and
also for bowstrings. It may, therefore, be presumed,
that they formed an important article of commerce.<a id='r1548' /><a href='#f1548' class='c014'><sup>[1548]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Here, likewise, were quarries of porphyry,<a id='r1549' /><a href='#f1549' class='c014'><sup>[1549]</sup></a> from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>which, in earlier ages, the island is said to have
obtained the name of Porphyrussa. At the distance
of a mile and a quarter from Scandia stood the
city of Cythera, with an Acropolis situated on a
very high rock. At this place was a temple of the
celestial Aphroditè, esteemed one of the most ancient
in Greece,<a id='r1550' /><a href='#f1550' class='c014'><sup>[1550]</sup></a> the inhabitants having addicted
themselves to the worship of this goddess, because,
when she first sprang from the waves, she is said
to have come floating thither on a shell of mother-of-pearl.<a id='r1551' /><a href='#f1551' class='c014'><sup>[1551]</sup></a>
How many of the productions of this
island passed annually into commerce cannot be
known. But, it is described as abounding, in modern
times, with wild asses, and deer, and hares,
and quails, and turtle-doves,<a id='r1552' /><a href='#f1552' class='c014'><sup>[1552]</sup></a> which last were, of
old, sacred to the goddess of the isle. Corn, also,
and oil, and wine of excellent quality, were found
in Cythera, though by no means in abundance. It
likewise produces tragoriganon and bastard dittany.
The island being thus productive, it is by no means
surprising that the Spartans should have set a high
value on it, and sent thither, annually, a magistrate,
named Cytherodices, together with a garrison of
heavy-armed men. Another advantage which Sparta
derived from the possession of this island was, that
it served it as a kind of defence against the incursions
of pirates, commanding, in some sort, the
narrow sea between Peloponnesos and Crete.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>That this was no small advantage will be evident
if we consider to what extent, and with how much
cruelty, piracy was exercised in old times. It dogged
incessantly the heels of commerce, appearing on
every sea and penetrating to every land whither industry
betook itself for the acquisition of wealth.
It may be said, indeed, to have been a kind of
bastard brother of trade, both proceeding from the
desire of gain. Against the masters of this craft
the first war-galleys appear to have been fitted
out in the Mediterranean. For, among the principal
exploits of the half-fabulous king of Crete is
enumerated his clearing the sea of pirates, his object
being to secure the transmission of his revenues
from the smaller islands to the seat of empire.
For, in old times, both the Greeks and barbarians
of the continent, inhabiting the sea-coast,
and all those who dwelt in the islands, no sooner
addicted themselves to navigation, than they took to
piracy, being led by their most powerful fellow-citizens,
partly for their own advantage, and partly
with a view of providing for the poor; and falling
suddenly on unwalled cities, or people dispersed in
villages, they plundered the whole country, and
thus chiefly procured themselves subsistence. Nor,
in fact, was this sort of life attended with disgrace,
but with some degree of honour. Even in Thucydides’
own time, many tribes of the continent gloried
in their piratical skill, and from the ancient
poets, he says, it was clear the same feeling had
always prevailed; for, the first question put to seamen,
on their landing, was, whether they were pirates
or not; and this without the persons interrogated considering
it to be any offence, or those who asked intending
any.<a id='r1553' /><a href='#f1553' class='c014'><sup>[1553]</sup></a> No idea of caste seems to have existed.
The reception of Pelops, who came with great wealth
from Asia into Peloponnesos, shows that riches, however
acquired, were valued before both; for he might
have been, and, probably, was, a pirate.<a id='r1554' /><a href='#f1554' class='c014'><sup>[1554]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>In the interior, also, plundering expeditions were
carried on by land, as on the borders of England
or Scotland, and more anciently on the Welsh
marshes. And up to the period of the Peloponnesian
war, many Greek nations still continued to live after
the ancient manner, as the Ozolian and Epicnemidian
Locrians, the Ætolians, the Acarnanians, and other
neighbouring tribes, of which their habit of wearing
arms may be considered as a memento. To repress
the ravages of these half-civilized races was often
an object of great concern to the Athenians, who,
to check the cruises of the Opuntians, long accustomed
to enrich themselves by plundering the coast
of Eubœa during the Peloponnesian war, took and
fortified the uninhabited island of Atalantè.<a id='r1555' /><a href='#f1555' class='c014'><sup>[1555]</sup></a> Some
ages before, they had, under the conduct of Cimon,
expelled from Scyros the piratical Dolopians, who
not only scoured the neighbouring seas, but even
plundered such vessels as put into their harbour.<a id='r1556' /><a href='#f1556' class='c014'><sup>[1556]</sup></a>
Nothing, however, could extirpate the evil, which
has always continued to be the curse of those seas,
sometimes denounced, sometimes encouraged, by the
princes of the neighbouring countries, who, like Philip
of Macedon, find it convenient, according to the exigencies
of their affairs, to make war upon the buccaneers,
or to unite with them in pursuit of plunder.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all the Doric states the most commercial was
undoubtedly Corinth. That, situated on the isthmus
by which the Peloponnesos is united with the
rest of Greece, became very early an emporium, and
rose to opulence<a id='r1557' /><a href='#f1557' class='c014'><sup>[1557]</sup></a> and splendour; for whatever merchandise
was transported from northern Greece into
any of the states of the peninsula by land, necessarily
passed through this city, and paying, as was customary,
transit dues, tended greatly to enrich it. The
same thing may be said of the productions of the
Peloponnesos, which, by this road, found their way
into Hellas. Afterwards addicting themselves to navigation,
the Corinthians, from their two ports of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Lechæum and Cenchreæ,<a id='r1558' /><a href='#f1558' class='c014'><sup>[1558]</sup></a> carried on an extremely extensive
commerce with Italy and the countries on the
Adriatic on the one hand, and with Asia Minor<a id='r1559' /><a href='#f1559' class='c014'><sup>[1559]</sup></a> and
the islands on the other; so that whatever articles of
commerce are reckoned among the imports of Athens
were likewise in a measure to be found at Corinth.
The aversion of the ancient mariners to double Cape
Malea long secured its trade to Corinth. There was
a proverb<a id='r1560' /><a href='#f1560' class='c014'><sup>[1560]</sup></a> which said, that whoever sailed round that
redoubtable promontory must be unmindful of his
friends at home; and, in truth, the boisterous and
contrary winds which still encounter the mariner
who passes from the Myrtoan to the Ionian sea might
well appear terrible to the small craft of remote
antiquity. To avoid this dangerous navigation these
barks themselves, together with the merchandise they
carried, were drawn across the isthmus, and launched
again on the opposite sea. The project of Nero,
therefore, who designed to open a canal at this place,
would, if completed, have proved of the greatest service
to the Corinthians, whose city might have continued
to be enriched by it to the present day.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to the articles which Corinth herself
supplied to commerce, they will be found enumerated
among the exports and imports of Greece.
Her manufactures were numerous and important,<a id='r1561' /><a href='#f1561' class='c014'><sup>[1561]</sup></a>
consisting, among others, of rich coverlets, fine woollen
garments, costly pottery, and works in that rich
metal known under the name of Corinthian bronze.
This, it is said, consisted of a small mixture of gold
and silver with brass; though, according to another
account, it was produced by heating the metal red-hot,
and in that state plunging it into the waters of Peirenè.<a id='r1562' /><a href='#f1562' class='c014'><sup>[1562]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Much trade was carried on in the territories of
Corinth during the celebration of the Isthmian games,
which, bringing together a vast multitude of people
from Ionia, Sicily, Italy, Libya, Thessaly, and the
extremities of the Black Sea, necessarily attracted
thither, among the rest, the retailers of all kinds of
provisions. These finding a speedy market for their
goods, other tradesmen followed their example, so
that at length assemblies, originating in religion,
resembled prodigious fairs,<a id='r1563' /><a href='#f1563' class='c014'><sup>[1563]</sup></a> whither every description
of merchandise was conveyed for the admiration and
purchase of the pilgrims.<a id='r1564' /><a href='#f1564' class='c014'><sup>[1564]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is, however, with much difficulty that we obtain
an insight into the manner<a id='r1565' /><a href='#f1565' class='c014'><sup>[1565]</sup></a> in which the inland
traffic of Greece was carried on in the earlier
ages; but it is probable, that, as in India, Egypt,
and Arabia, great fairs were held on some convenient
spot, whither the sellers and buyers resorted
from all the countries around. That this was the
case in many places we know. There was, for example,
a monthly fair held at Aleision,<a id='r1566' /><a href='#f1566' class='c014'><sup>[1566]</sup></a> near Amphidolis
in Eleia, on the mountain road from Elis
to Olympia, to which all the peasants of the neighbourhood
resorted. Among the Romans smaller
fairs or markets were held every nine days, and
were thence called nundinia.<a id='r1567' /><a href='#f1567' class='c014'><sup>[1567]</sup></a> On these occasions
the rustics intermitted their usual employment and
repaired to the city, as well to furnish themselves
with what they needed, as to learn what new laws
or regulations might have been promulgated in the
interim.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Epidamnians, who, as Müller<a id='r1568' /><a href='#f1568' class='c014'><sup>[1568]</sup></a> observes, “retained
much of ancient custom, paid great attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>to the intercourse with foreigners,” and held
great annual fairs, which were frequented by the
neighbouring Illyrians. By this is meant, strange
as it would seem, that they sought to cut off all
such intercourse. For, as Plutarch<a id='r1569' /><a href='#f1569' class='c014'><sup>[1569]</sup></a> relates in his
Greek Questions, the people of Epidamnia living
in the vicinity of the Illyrians, and observing, that
such of their citizens as associated with them grew
corrupt, and fearing innovation, elected one of their
chief citizens to conduct the necessary intercourse
and the barter which took place annually at a great
fair. This officer, called Poletes, acted as broker-general
for his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1465'>1465</a>. The reader will find in the
work of Monsieur F. Thiersch, De
l’Etat actuel de la Grèce, t. ii. p.
72, sqq., an interesting and instructive
chapter on the trade carried
on by the descendants of that
people whose manners and customs
I have undertaken to describe.
He there enters at length
into the advantageous position of
the country, and the upright and
honourable character of its inhabitants,
of whose singular probity
he produces many proofs. Other
writers have taken a different
view of the modern Greek character.
But I am disposed to place
more reliance on the statement of
M. Thiersch than on that of those
prejudiced travellers who desire to
obtain a reputation for exactness
by an ill-natured interpretation of
a free people whose hospitality
they have enjoyed, and in too

descents that the early inhabitants
of Greece, for the most
part, erected their towns and villages
at some distance from the
sea-coast, in situations difficult
of access. Thucyd. § 7. Similar
reasons have elsewhere led in
modern times to similar results.
Thus, in Alicuda, the remotest
and most exposed of the Lipari
islands, the dwellings of their
simple natives and their priests
are perched high in the hills
among rocks and steep acclivities,
through fear of the Barbary
corsairs, who, from time to time,
land there, and carry away into
captivity whomsoever they are
able to seize and subdue. Further,
to guard against these incursions,
a sentinel is stationed
on the Monte della Guardia, in
the principal isle, where he keeps
watch day and night. Spallanzani,

  <h3 id='ch6.9' class='c012'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> COMMERCE OF ATTICA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>To speak now of the commerce of Attica, the
most extensive and important in the ancient world.
It is an error shared by persons in other respects
above the vulgar, that a commercial people is necessarily
sordid; and hence Napoleon considered it
opprobrious to the English, that they are a nation,
as he expressed it, of shopkeepers. There are some
lessons in the science of human nature that Napoleon
had not learned, among which this is one,—that
the greatest, wisest, and most virtuous of mankind
have risen and flourished in trading communities,
and been themselves in many instances engaged
in commerce. No country in the modern
world has produced men of more chivalrous honour
or heroic disinterestedness than England; and in
antiquity the Athenians, as a community and as
individuals, far outshone in wisdom, high-mindedness,
and patriotism, every other people with whom we
could compare them. In one word, they were the
English of antiquity;—bold, adventurous, indefatigable
people, equally renowned in trade, philosophy,
and war. That they were less fortunate may
be accounted for from their geographical position,
lacking the inestimable advantage which we enjoy
in being seated on an island,—a misfortune well
understood by Pericles, who alludes to it in his
first oration for the war.<a id='r1570' /><a href='#f1570' class='c014'><sup>[1570]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>No country, however fertile, produces all that its
inhabitants, when advancing in civilisation, require,
which tends more than any other circumstance to
promote the amelioration of society; and Attica,
from its comparative barrenness and very limited
extent, peculiarly experienced the necessity of foreign
commerce. To this accordingly the Athenians
from a very early period applied themselves,
and with so much success, that whatever commodities
the ancient world produced were generally
to be found in the greatest abundance in their city.<a id='r1571' /><a href='#f1571' class='c014'><sup>[1571]</sup></a>
They enjoyed as has been already observed, most
of the advantages of insular position, that is,<a id='r1572' /><a href='#f1572' class='c014'><sup>[1572]</sup></a> excellent
harbours conveniently situated, in which
they received supplies during all winds,<a id='r1573' /><a href='#f1573' class='c014'><sup>[1573]</sup></a> and, in addition
to these, some of the compensating advantages
of being situated on the continent, in facilities
for inland traffic. Chief of all, however,
were the blessings flowing from the wisdom, and
moderation, and liberality, of its government, which
rendered Athens the resort of all the enterprising
and enlightened men of every other country. Its
dealings with foreigners were facilitated by the purity
of the coin, as the traders who did not choose
to purchase merchandise might take bullion, which,
as Xenophon expresses it, was a very handsome
article, and of so little alloy as everywhere to pass
for more than its nominal value, like the old Spanish
dollars, and English gold currency in the East.<a id='r1574' /><a href='#f1574' class='c014'><sup>[1574]</sup></a>
Prohibitions to export money, as Bœckh observes,
were unknown in ancient times, and are only
compatible with bills of exchange.<a id='r1575' /><a href='#f1575' class='c014'><sup>[1575]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Though war to a certain extent interfered with
Athenian commerce, yet, being masters of the sea,
they could generally command a plentiful supply
of foreign commodities, so that many articles regarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>as rare in other countries might be found
abundantly in the warehouses of the Peiræeus. “Hither,
on account of the richness of our city,” says
Pericles, “are borne the products of all lands, so
that we are not more familiar with the use of
wheat grown in Attica than with the productions
of other countries.”<a id='r1576' /><a href='#f1576' class='c014'><sup>[1576]</sup></a> So Isocrates: “the Peiræeus,
has been established as an emporium in the heart of
Greece, and so far excels all its rivals, that articles
with difficulty met with singly in other ports
may be readily found here altogether.”<a id='r1577' /><a href='#f1577' class='c014'><sup>[1577]</sup></a> And true
it is, that every region of the east and island of the
Mediterranean poured their productions into Attica,
whence they were distributed throughout Greece.
Thither were brought the magnificent carpets and
fine wool of Persia, Phrygia, and Miletos; the
gloves and purple of Tyre and Sidon; the fine
linen of Egypt;<a id='r1578' /><a href='#f1578' class='c014'><sup>[1578]</sup></a> the gold and ivory of Africa; the
pearls of India and the Red Sea;<a id='r1579' /><a href='#f1579' class='c014'><sup>[1579]</sup></a> white and
black slaves, and corn, and timber, and spices, and
costly wines, and perfumes from Spain, Sicily, Italy,
Cypros, Lydia, the Black Sea, and the farthest regions
of the east.<a id='r1580' /><a href='#f1580' class='c014'><sup>[1580]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This extended commerce, and the encouragement
which strangers of all countries found to settle at
Athens, rendered it the home of all languages and
religions,<a id='r1581' /><a href='#f1581' class='c014'><sup>[1581]</sup></a> and led to the adoption of many barbarous
words. But she thus created a boundless market
for her own exports, whether consisting of manufactures
or the surplus produce of the soil; and as
we now retail to the Continental nations many productions
of Eastern Asia, so the Athenians disposed, in
the uncommercial countries around, of the commodities
they had elsewhere collected. For example,
they found a vent among the nations on the Black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Sea for the wines of the islands and shores of the
Ægean, Peparethos, Cos, Thasos, Mendè, Skionè, Lemnos,
and Crete.<a id='r1582' /><a href='#f1582' class='c014'><sup>[1582]</sup></a> From a passage in Xenophon, it
would appear either that Greek sailors amused themselves
by reading on their voyages, or that books were
exported to Pontos, for there seems to be no foundation
for the suspicions that they were blank books.<a id='r1583' /><a href='#f1583' class='c014'><sup>[1583]</sup></a>
“Here,” says Xenophon, speaking of the coast of
Thrace, “are found numerous beds, cabinets, books,
and such other things as shipmasters are accustomed
to transport in chests.”<a id='r1584' /><a href='#f1584' class='c014'><sup>[1584]</sup></a> Theopompos represents the
Persians as carrying books (χάρται βιβλίων) along with
them in their invasion of Egypt, and the Greeks could
have been scarcely less literary.<a id='r1585' /><a href='#f1585' class='c014'><sup>[1585]</sup></a> Certain, at all
events, it is, that there was a book-market at Athens,
probably resembling the bazars of the East, where
the dealers in manuscripts kept their shops;<a id='r1586' /><a href='#f1586' class='c014'><sup>[1586]</sup></a> and
thence, in all likelihood, the Greek cities on the
Black Sea were supplied; and this is by no means
inconsistent with the proverb respecting Hermodoros,
Plato’s Sicilian publisher, who was said, contemptuously,
to traffic in words; for, as he himself was one
of Plato’s hearers, it may have been thought beneath
him to turn trader.<a id='r1587' /><a href='#f1587' class='c014'><sup>[1587]</sup></a> Somewhat later we read of
Zeno, a stranger in the city, going into a bookseller’s
shop to sit down, where he finds the owner reading
Xenophon, and is recommended by him to follow
Crates.<a id='r1588' /><a href='#f1588' class='c014'><sup>[1588]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>So extensive a trade as Athens carried on could
not be conducted without protecting regulations, and
the co-operation of a commercial police. Accordingly
the government exhibited much wisdom and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>liberality in whatever related to commerce, by all
means seeking to encourage enterprise and industry.
Numerous officers were appointed to watch over the
commercial dealings of the citizens; such as the
superintendents of the harbour, ten persons appointed
annually by lot; the overseers of the market, likewise
ten, of whom five superintended the markets in the
city, the other five, those in the Peiræeus; fifteen
inspectors of weights and measures, ten of whom
attended in the city, the other five those in the port;
and subordinate, probably, to these were the public
meters, who seem to have been Scythians, and therefore
slaves of the state: their duty was to measure
whatever grain was sold in the market,<a id='r1589' /><a href='#f1589' class='c014'><sup>[1589]</sup></a> for which
was paid a small sum, applied, it may be supposed,
to the augmentation of the revenue. Great care,
in fact, was bestowed on the subject of weights and
measures, and to the market regulations generally;
and yet we find from the comic poets<a id='r1590' /><a href='#f1590' class='c014'><sup>[1590]</sup></a> that much
fraud was occasionally committed.<a id='r1591' /><a href='#f1591' class='c014'><sup>[1591]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is, by some writers, supposed that credit was at a
low ebb in Greece; but this notion seems to have been
formed hastily, without allowing for circumstances,
as the condition of the times sufficiently accounts for
the facts which suggested it; for all large and established
houses are known to have possessed almost
unlimited credit, since they were able, on the mere
security of their name, to raise whatever money they
needed; so that none, probably, but persons little
known, or not known advantageously, were required
to give security.<a id='r1592' /><a href='#f1592' class='c014'><sup>[1592]</sup></a> The inhabitants of certain cities,
as, for example, of Phaselis, enjoyed, as we say, a
bad reputation,<a id='r1593' /><a href='#f1593' class='c014'><sup>[1593]</sup></a> and were, no doubt, among those
whom people refused to trust.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>If severity, however, in the laws of debtor and
creditor have any tendency to support credit, the
confiding portion of the community had little reason
to complain at Athens, since the spirit of this
branch of Athenian jurisprudence was unusually
stern. The man who obtained the loan of money
and fraudulently withheld his security, was deemed
to have committed a capital offence, nor could his
high rank or honourable connexions skreen him from
punishment.<a id='r1594' /><a href='#f1594' class='c014'><sup>[1594]</sup></a> For it was considered, observes the
orator, that an offender of this description not only
defrauded the individuals with whom he dealt, but
also made an attempt against the sources of public
prosperity, commercial operations depending not on
the borrower but on the lender, without whose coöperation
no ship, or captain, or passenger, can move.
On which account the most effective protection was
afforded them by law.</p>

<p class='c001'>Merchants and sea-captains were also defended
by very severe enactments against false accusers,
who, upon conviction, were heavily fined, and, in
default of payment, deprived of the rights of citizenship.<a id='r1595' /><a href='#f1595' class='c014'><sup>[1595]</sup></a>
Causes of this kind were tried in the
Commercial Court of the Nautodikæ, which was
also empowered to examine the claims of citizens
accused of foreign extraction.<a id='r1596' /><a href='#f1596' class='c014'><sup>[1596]</sup></a> The causes were
introduced by the Thesmothetæ, and in lawsuits
between citizens of different nations, by virtue of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>a particular agreement, there existed an appeal from
one state to the other.<a id='r1597' /><a href='#f1597' class='c014'><sup>[1597]</sup></a> Nothing more clearly shows
the consideration in which nautical and mercantile
affairs were held at Athens, than the laws which
regulated the proceedings of this court: in the first
place, not to interrupt the course of business and
occasion loss to individuals, the Nautodikæ sat during
the winter months, from September till March,
when navigation was usually suspended. At first,
indeed, they did not commence their sittings till
January;<a id='r1598' /><a href='#f1598' class='c014'><sup>[1598]</sup></a> but this was found inconvenient, the decision
of the court being frequently delayed till late
in the spring or summer, to the great loss and detriment
of the litigants. Consequences still more
disastrous, perhaps, ensued when the cause stood
over till the ensuing winter, when, as new judges
would be appointed, the whole business had to be
commenced <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de novo</i></span>. To remedy this evil a plan
of reform was conceived by Xenophon,<a id='r1599' /><a href='#f1599' class='c014'><sup>[1599]</sup></a> but with
nothing like a statesman’s views, its chief merit
consisting in proposing a prize to be awarded to
the most able and expeditious judge. His scheme,
however, may have had the merit of fixing the attention
of wiser men upon the subject, which at
length produced the monthly suits to which belonged
all causes concerning trade-clubs, dowries,
and mines.<a id='r1600' /><a href='#f1600' class='c014'><sup>[1600]</sup></a> Upon the introduction of this improvement
in the practice of the commercial court the
advantage proposed by Xenophon was fully obtained,
since causes could not, as some have imagined, stand
over from month to month, but must absolutely be
decided within the term.<a id='r1601' /><a href='#f1601' class='c014'><sup>[1601]</sup></a> The more completely
to protect and advance the interests of commerce,
each state had its consul<a id='r1602' /><a href='#f1602' class='c014'><sup>[1602]</sup></a> (προξένος) who represented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>the interests of his country, and, like our own consuls
in the Levant, was bound to receive and entertain
such citizens as arrived at the port where
he resided. Besides, when a merchant or trader
died abroad, it was part of the consul’s duty to
take charge of his property, and transmit immediately
to his friends an account of what had taken
place, with the necessary particulars.<a id='r1603' /><a href='#f1603' class='c014'><sup>[1603]</sup></a> Occasionally,
however, very improper persons obtained this respectable
and, no doubt, lucrative situation, as the
man Lycidas, formerly one of Chabrias’s slaves, who
contrived, by intrigue, to be appointed consul of
Messina; and Dionysios, a man of like origin and
character, and by birth a Megarean, who enjoyed
the honour of representing Athens at Megara.<a id='r1604' /><a href='#f1604' class='c014'><sup>[1604]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It has been made a question, whether or not
perfect freedom of trade existed among the ancients,
and upon the whole it appears, that among the
Athenians, at least, no unwise or vexatious interference
habitually took place.<a id='r1605' /><a href='#f1605' class='c014'><sup>[1605]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Bœckh remarks that, in the plan of Xenophon
for restoring the revenue, no allusion is made to
the removal of onerous restrictions on trade; from
which it may be inferred that none such existed.
Heeren<a id='r1606' /><a href='#f1606' class='c014'><sup>[1606]</sup></a> is clearly of this opinion: “nothing was
known of the balance of trade, and consequently
all the violent measures resulting from it were
never devised by the Greeks. They had duties
as well as the moderns; but these duties were
exacted only for the sake of increasing the public
revenue, not to direct the efforts of domestic industry
by the prohibition of certain wares. There
was no prohibition of the exportation of the raw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>produce; no encouragement of manufactures at
the expense of the agriculturist. In this respect,
therefore, there existed a freedom of industry, commerce,
and trade. And such was the general
custom. As every thing was decided by circumstances,
and not by theories, there may have been
single exceptions, and perhaps single examples,
where the state for a season usurped a monopoly.
But how far was this from the mercantile and
restrictive system of the moderns!”</p>

<p class='c001'>This it appears to me is the philosophical view
of the matter, which is not modified materially by
the remarks of Bœckh. No doubt the interests of
the state were regarded as paramount, comprehending,
as in just states they do, the interests of all
individuals; but for this very reason they would,
to the best of their knowledge, beware of interfering
capriciously or unnecessarily with private interests,
since a prosperous community cannot be
constituted of unprosperous members. Mr. Bœckh
seems, with all his learning and acuteness, to misapprehend
the political theory of the ancients, and
to imagine that, because the right of governments
to regulate the actions of individuals was recognized,
they might safely do so on all occasions
without rhyme or reason. But in this he is certainly
in error. The object of government was understood
then as well as it is now; so that I am
apt to think that the erudite professor advances,
in the following passage, a doctrine which would
have met with but a cold reception among the
Athenians, though adopted literally by the historians
of the Doric race: “Not in Crete and Lacedæmon
alone, two states completely closed up, and
from their position unsusceptible of free trade,
but generally throughout the whole of Greece, and
even under the free and republican government of
Athens, the poorest as well as the richest citizen
was convinced that the state had the right of
claiming the whole property of every individual;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>any restriction in the transfer of this property,
regulated according to circumstances, was looked
upon as just, nor could it properly be considered
an infringement of justice before the security of
person and property was held to be the sole object
of government; a light under which it never
was viewed by any of the ancients.”<a id='r1607' /><a href='#f1607' class='c014'><sup>[1607]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It would be difficult to select from any writer,
ancient or modern, a passage more abounding than
this with erroneous conclusions. Neither Lacedæmon
nor Crete was excluded by its position from the advantages
of free trade; and at Athens there was no
citizen, however poor or ignorant, who acknowledged
in the state any such right as Mr. Bœckh speaks
of, except for the purpose of providing for the general
safety, in which case it would be as cheerfully
acknowledged in every modern community. While
penning the concluding sentence, Mr. Bœckh must
have been thinking of the despotic governments of
Germany. An Englishman considers the preservation
of his political rights as much an object of
government as the protection of his person or his
property, and would as strenuously contend for it,
in which feeling he resembles the Athenian. But
I will not permit even this theme to tempt me
from the matter in hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be no difficulty in admitting that, as the
very existence of commerce, properly so called, depends
on the existence of political communities, the
state has a right to interfere, under certain circumstances,
with the movements of commerce. For
example, merchants may justly be prevented by the
laws from furnishing their country’s enemy with arms,
with ammunition, with provisions, in short, with any
article whatsoever, which, by strengthening the hands
of the foe, may tend to the detriment of their own
community. Again, in famines and scarcities, the
law of self-preservation authorizes states to restrain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>the exportation of articles absolutely required for
home consumption; because distress produces discontent
and tumult and insurrection, and may thus
endanger the very existence of the government itself.
Prohibitions to export, originating in such motives,
are perfectly defensible. But so much can scarcely be
said for monopolies, which were not unknown to the
Greeks, though it is not denied that they were of short
duration.<a id='r1608' /><a href='#f1608' class='c014'><sup>[1608]</sup></a> “It can, however, be safely asserted,” says
Mr. Bœckh, “that no republic ever demanded of its
citizens that they should furnish commodities to the
state in specific quantities, and at prices arbitrarily
fixed at a low rate, with a view to secure to itself
a monopoly: such a demand could only have been
enforced in countries under the government of a
tyrant.”<a id='r1609' /><a href='#f1609' class='c014'><sup>[1609]</sup></a> The folly, as well as the wickedness, of
such despotic interference, I witnessed in the depopulation
and misery of Egypt, which at length proceeded
so far as to alarm the Pasha himself, and
produce some amelioration of his vicious system.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is, no doubt, possible, that many monopolies
of which we know nothing may have existed in antiquity;<a id='r1610' /><a href='#f1610' class='c014'><sup>[1610]</sup></a>
but it will be quite evident that, upon such
possibility, it would be useless to reason. The monopolies
which we know to have existed were few,
and of short duration. Aristotle, while observing
what advantages both individuals and states sometimes
derived from them, attributes a better policy
to Athens. He gives two or three examples of
private monopolies, the well-known story of Thales
and the oil-presses, and that of a man who bought
up all the iron<a id='r1611' /><a href='#f1611' class='c014'><sup>[1611]</sup></a> at Syracuse, and adds, that, in great
pecuniary straits, governments were sometimes found
to imitate them.<a id='r1612' /><a href='#f1612' class='c014'><sup>[1612]</sup></a> Thus, at a late period of their
history, the Athenians are supposed to have monopolised
the lead obtained from the silver mines of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Laureion, which they did, we are told, at the instigation
of Pythoclos; that is, they bought it up at
the usual price of two drachmas the commercial
talent, and sold it at six drachmas.<a id='r1613' /><a href='#f1613' class='c014'><sup>[1613]</sup></a> At Rome the
price was higher. As there can be little doubt that
the lead was for exportation, no injury was inflicted
on individuals. With respect to the monopoly granted
by the Byzantines to a banker, it may be observed,
that it was only one of the many shifts to which
the nakedness of their treasury compelled them to
have recourse. The list is given in the second book
of the Economics, and is not without interest. I
would not affirm that their contrivances were innocent.<a id='r1614' /><a href='#f1614' class='c014'><sup>[1614]</sup></a>
Again, the Selymbrians, in a period of public
difficulty, constituted themselves monopolists in a
manner which Mr. Bœckh might fearlessly have pronounced
“less defensible.” By law they were not
permitted to export in times of scarcity; but being
in want of money, they decreed that the state should
purchase all the old stock at a fixed price, leaving
individuals sufficient for their yearly consumption,
after which they sold the surplus at a higher price,
with permission to export.<a id='r1615' /><a href='#f1615' class='c014'><sup>[1615]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is difficult to say what men will agree to consider
“perfect freedom of trade;” but it appears to me,
that commerce was as unshackled at Athens as it
could have been consistently with the welfare of the
community. Mr. Bœckh says, “There are abundant
proofs that exportation and importation were regulated
according to the exigencies and interests of
the community, which is by no means consistent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>with the perfect freedom of trade.”<a id='r1616' /><a href='#f1616' class='c014'><sup>[1616]</sup></a> There appears
to lurk a fallacy in this. Such freedom as this
writer would call perfect is inconsistent with the
very existence of civil society, whose fundamental
laws require that no man’s freedom shall trench upon
the freedom, and still less upon the life, of another.
But if in commerce the exigencies and interests of the
community could have been set at nought, there would
have been an end of such community, since frequently
its well-being, if not its being, depended on its commercial
relations with foreign states.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far, therefore, it must, doubtless, be admitted,
that commerce was not free. To this extent, and
no further, does Aristotle counsel or contemplate
interferences with trade: “With regard to importation
and exportation,” he says, “it is necessary to
know how large a supply of provisions the state
requires, and what proportion of them can be produced
in the country and what imported, and what
imports and exports are necessary for the state, in
order that commercial treaties and agreements may
be concluded with those of whom the state must
make use for this purpose.”<a id='r1617' /><a href='#f1617' class='c014'><sup>[1617]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With regard to the prohibition to export attributed
to Solon, it is necessary either to abandon
the subject altogether, or to understand it in the
contrary sense to that usually given. Plutarch, as
his text now stands, tells a very strange story, observing,
that the exportation of every thing but oil
was prohibited by Solon, and therefore he adds, it
is not wholly improbable that figs also were prohibited.<a id='r1618' /><a href='#f1618' class='c014'><sup>[1618]</sup></a>
I understand the matter differently. Solon,
probably observing that Attica, at that time, produced
barely sufficient oil for its own consumption,
prohibited its exportation, though as agriculture improved,
the law fell into desuetude, and oil became
a principal export. From this example, Plutarch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>thinks it not improbable, that figs also may at some
time or another have been prohibited. The matter
is thus clear and natural. Besides, the Scholiast
on Pindar, alluding no doubt to some particular
period, observes, that the exportation of oil was
not permitted.<a id='r1619' /><a href='#f1619' class='c014'><sup>[1619]</sup></a> It is therefore surprising that B&oelig;ckh
should have laid any stress at all on so contradictory
a passage, without endeavouring to restore it,
particularly as Solon was himself a merchant and
a transgressor of his supposed law. That the exportation
of corn should not have been allowed is
both intelligible and reasonable, as Attica never produced
sufficient for its own consumption; and they
were not disposed to adopt the system of the modern
Tuscans, who would sell their own corn to
the English, and subsist on an inferior sort from
the Black Sea, if indeed it be inferior.<a id='r1620' /><a href='#f1620' class='c014'><sup>[1620]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Certain commodities were, however, undoubtedly
not allowed to be exported, as for example, timber,
tar, wax, rigging, and “leathern bottles, articles
which,” as B&oelig;ckh observes, “were particularly important
for the building and equipment of the
fleet.”<a id='r1621' /><a href='#f1621' class='c014'><sup>[1621]</sup></a> But the word which this distinguished
scholar conceives to mean “leathern bottles,” had
a very different signification, and meant that leathern
defence through which the oars passed, and which
was designed to keep the sea from rushing in at
the row-port. This we gather as well from the
scholiast on Aristophanes,<a id='r1622' /><a href='#f1622' class='c014'><sup>[1622]</sup></a> as from several passages
of Pollux overlooked by B&oelig;ckh. This writer observes,
that the leathern defence of the row-port
was called ἄσκωμα,<a id='r1623' /><a href='#f1623' class='c014'><sup>[1623]</sup></a> and elsewhere he says that a
woman’s breast, when full of milk, was also so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>called;<a id='r1624' /><a href='#f1624' class='c014'><sup>[1624]</sup></a> from which we may conjecture what form
the askoma assumed, when the oar forced it outwards
during the act of rowing. Nor do I suppose
that such prohibition existed only during time of
war, for it would have been equally imprudent to
furnish such articles to men preparing for war, as
men always are in peace, as to such as were actually
engaged in it. From a passage in Theophrastus,
it has been inferred that permission to export
timber for ship-building was sometimes granted
free of duty to individuals; but as it is the Boaster
who makes the assertion, adding that, to avoid envy,
he never made use of it,<a id='r1625' /><a href='#f1625' class='c014'><sup>[1625]</sup></a> it may be regarded as
no less a joke than the reason for prohibiting lamp-wicks
from B&oelig;otia, viz., that they might set the
fleet on fire!<a id='r1626' /><a href='#f1626' class='c014'><sup>[1626]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The prohibition to export arms during war to the
country of the enemy, and that under pain of death,<a id='r1627' /><a href='#f1627' class='c014'><sup>[1627]</sup></a>
was an obvious measure of self-defence. In time of
peace, however, the trade in arms was as free as any
other trade; and the Athenians imported from their
neighbours, the B&oelig;otians, helmets,<a id='r1628' /><a href='#f1628' class='c014'><sup>[1628]</sup></a> in the manufacture
of which this people excelled. No doubt, as states
derive the sinews of war, in part at least, from commerce,
the Athenians had the sagacity to attack their
enemies in the vulnerable point of their pride, for
the purpose of bringing them the sooner to reason.
They thus, too, taught the inferior states, such as
Megara and B&oelig;otia, that Athens was independent
of them in all respects, while it was for them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>consider whether they were equally independent of
her.<a id='r1629' /><a href='#f1629' class='c014'><sup>[1629]</sup></a> Thus the Ocean Queen of antiquity was said
to exercise (as Great Britain formerly) a despotic
sway over trade; as when, for example, she exacted a
tenth from all ships sailing to or from the Black Sea;<a id='r1630' /><a href='#f1630' class='c014'><sup>[1630]</sup></a>
though in this, as in all human affairs, the despotism<a id='r1631' /><a href='#f1631' class='c014'><sup>[1631]</sup></a>
arose naturally from the possession of superior power,
and could scarcely have been guarded against. To
weaken the enemy by every possible means was the
object of a wise policy; so that in contemplating
every coast belonging to a power not in alliance with
Athens as in a state of blockade,<a id='r1632' /><a href='#f1632' class='c014'><sup>[1632]</sup></a>—in seizing, capturing,
or detaining, all vessels of every description
by which her interests could be infringed, Athens
only acted in self-defence. That she was hated for
her superiority we need not be surprised, who know
with what heart-burnings and secret aversion our own
maritime supremacy has ever been beheld by the
nations of the Continent, who repeat against us all
the accusations anciently muttered by the surrounding
states against Athens.</p>

<p class='c001'>Utopian speculators, reading history in their easy
chairs, find it facile to condemn the measures of ancient
statesmen. But allowing them to have been
reprehensible, it remains to be seen whether, in the
same circumstances, we could have carried any better
into execution; for the ability to imagine better is
nothing, unless we suppose that events always allow
men to act up to their knowledge. However this
may be, the Athenian government found itself compelled
by its position sometimes to interfere with
the course of trade; but it may well be doubted
whether any other freedom of trade than there existed
be either possible or desirable. For, both commerce,
and every other mode in which the energies
of a nation can develope themselves, should no otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>exist than as they are beneficial to the nation
at large; and of this the managers of public business
ought always to be better judges than merchants
or speculators, who only consider their own interests,
which may not always be identical with those of
the state. I am far, however, from designing to
maintain that the commercial regulations of Athens
were in no case oppressive. Perhaps in the matter
of the corn-trade they were so; and yet much may
be said for a populous city surrounded by a barren
country, and therefore solicitous about its own subsistence.
Let us examine those regulations. According
to the letter of the law, which was often
transgressed, no inhabitant of Athens could land a
cargo of corn anywhere but on the Peiræeus; but,
arrived there, and the necessities of the state provided
for, the remainder could be disposed of elsewhere.
This was the full amount of the grievance,
if it ought to be so called.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to the law which is supposed to
have restrained capitalists from lending money on
any vessel not returning to Athens with corn or
other commodities, it would be highly unreasonable,
with Mr. Bœckh, to denominate it “excessively
oppressive,” until we understand it.<a id='r1633' /><a href='#f1633' class='c014'><sup>[1633]</sup></a> For my own
part, until something better be proposed, I must
adopt the interpretation of Salmasius, that it was
not permitted to lend money for the purpose of
buying corn in other countries except upon the condition,
that that corn should be imported into Athens.<a id='r1634' /><a href='#f1634' class='c014'><sup>[1634]</sup></a>
There no doubt are difficulties attending this view
of the matter; but this is equally the case in whichever
way we understand it. It may have been
that, in order to render Athens as far as possible
the emporium of the world, the law required that
money should not be lent to merchants or supercargoes,
unless it was their intention to return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>thither with a lading, whether of corn or some
other commodity. But even this seems very doubtful.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, by whatever laws this branch of trade was
regulated, no doubt can exist as to its extent and
importance. For, as the population of Attica had,
at a very early period, outgrown the means of subsistence
supplied by the country itself, the republic
found itself constrained to depend for the primary
article of food upon the productions of foreign states,
to the amount of nearly one-third of its whole consumption;
that is to say, while there were grown
at home two hundred and ninety-two thousand three
hundred and ninety-two quarters, as may be proved
by calculation,<a id='r1635' /><a href='#f1635' class='c014'><sup>[1635]</sup></a> there were imported a hundred and
eighteen thousand quarters in the age of Demosthenes.
Earlier its importation of corn was still
more considerable, when the greater part of the
supply was obtained from Eubœa, by the way of
Oropos and the pass of Deceleia.<a id='r1636' /><a href='#f1636' class='c014'><sup>[1636]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of the hundred and eighteen thousand quarters
abovementioned, about sixty thousand were obtained
from the countries on the Black Sea, chiefly from
Theodosia, now Kaffa,<a id='r1637' /><a href='#f1637' class='c014'><sup>[1637]</sup></a> in the Crimea, the remainder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>from Thrace, the islands of the Ægæan, Egypt, and
Sicily.<a id='r1638' /><a href='#f1638' class='c014'><sup>[1638]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the people of Athens were subject to few scarcities;
and those they experienced happened in later
times, when their enemies had acquired the superiority
at sea. For so long as this state attended
to her own navy and maintained her maritime supremacy,
there was never, I believe, a deficiency
of the grain in Peiræeus,<a id='r1639' /><a href='#f1639' class='c014'><sup>[1639]</sup></a> though attempts were frequently
made by the corn-dealers to create a monopoly
and extort famine prices from the public,<a id='r1640' /><a href='#f1640' class='c014'><sup>[1640]</sup></a>
for which they were sometimes punished with
death. Numerous proofs of the ease with which
Athens could provision herself, occurred during the
latter years of the Peloponnesian war, and the age
immediately succeeding. Thus, when the Spartans,
with their king Agis, were in possession of the pass of
Deceleia, and ravaged habitually the whole territory
of Attica, they felt that even the occupation of
that important post was scarcely of any avail to
them so long as Athens remained mistress of the
sea, since they daily saw numbers of corn ships
from all parts of the Levant, sailing into the Peiræeus.<a id='r1641' /><a href='#f1641' class='c014'><sup>[1641]</sup></a>
Afterwards, when the Spartans had begun
to apply themselves to naval affairs, one of their
first endeavours was to distress Attica, by attacking
her corn ships, as on the occasion when Pollis
sought to capture the transports in the neighbourhood
of Geræstos, which however were relieved by
the fleet under Chabrias.<a id='r1642' /><a href='#f1642' class='c014'><sup>[1642]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>No inconvenience was ever experienced from the
reluctance of the corn-growing states to export their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>produce. On the contrary, the petty kings of the
countries on the Euxine were so anxious to secure
to themselves the custom of Athens, that they conferred
on that state numerous privileges and made
her great presents, in order to tempt her corn ships
into their harbours and prevent the application to
rival states. It may indeed be said, that peace was
scarcely ever interrupted between Athens and the
exporting countries, and that not through the Athenians
truckling to them to obtain their corn, but
through their truckling to the Athenians to be allowed
to supply them. Thus, as far as the experience
of antiquity can be relied on, it must be
concluded, that the country which purchases agricultural
produce invariably exercises a paramount
influence over the countries which supply it. It is
in fact a rule all the world over, that it is the customer
who coerces the dealer, not the dealer who
influences the customer.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, further, this immense importation of grain
did not throw any of the lands of Attica, however
poor and barren, out of cultivation.<a id='r1643' /><a href='#f1643' class='c014'><sup>[1643]</sup></a> On the contrary,
the powers of the soil were still taxed to
the utmost, and the processes of agriculture carried
to a much higher degree of perfection than in
any other part of Greece.<a id='r1644' /><a href='#f1644' class='c014'><sup>[1644]</sup></a> In fact, with its vineyards,
the whole of Attica resembled a continued
garden up to the very walls of the city.<a id='r1645' /><a href='#f1645' class='c014'><sup>[1645]</sup></a> From
which, as well as from positive testimony, it appears
evident, that the Athenians always retained their
partiality for rural labours,<a id='r1646' /><a href='#f1646' class='c014'><sup>[1646]</sup></a> notwithstanding the
extent to which the manufacturing system was carried
among them. The cultivation of the soil has,
indeed, so many charms for mankind, that they
will never desert it so long as it is able to provide
for their wants. Men become manufacturers
only when they can no longer live by agriculture.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>It should, perhaps, he added, that of the grain
imported into the Peiræeus the surplus was frequently
exported to other parts of Greece, when
the wants of the commonwealth had been properly
supplied, and that a slight fixed duty, for the sake
of revenue, appears to have been always levied on
imported grain.<a id='r1647' /><a href='#f1647' class='c014'><sup>[1647]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But this necessary of life was not generally paid
for in specie. On the contrary, it was with manufactures
that Greece purchased the corn of the
rude nations on the Euxine, whom, by her trade,
she gradually reclaimed from barbarism, inoculated
with a taste for harmless luxuries, and, at length,
even for Hellenic literature.<a id='r1648' /><a href='#f1648' class='c014'><sup>[1648]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In one case we find that the Nomadic Scythians
applied themselves to the cultivation of the
soil, and, of course, became stationary merely for
the purpose of supplying Greece with corn.<a id='r1649' /><a href='#f1649' class='c014'><sup>[1649]</sup></a> Again,
in the later ages of the Roman republic, when a
corn-field was a rarity in Italy, which had been
almost entirely converted by the nobility into gardens
and pleasure-grounds,<a id='r1650' /><a href='#f1650' class='c014'><sup>[1650]</sup></a> Sicily, Egypt, and other
agricultural countries of the Levant, furnished so
ample a supply of grain, that scarcity was never
experienced, except when the public officers were
grossly negligent of their duty. In fact, the carrying
trade devolved upon the Phœnicians, who, to
a great extent subsisting by it alone, were necessarily
most careful, for their own sake, to keep
up the supply.<a id='r1651' /><a href='#f1651' class='c014'><sup>[1651]</sup></a> Had the Romans been themselves
a commercial people, like the English, their traffic
might have been still better regulated.</p>

<p class='c001'>To return, however: it is admitted, that liberal
as, upon the whole, the principles of trade were in
antiquity, those of the Athenians were the most
so of any.<a id='r1652' /><a href='#f1652' class='c014'><sup>[1652]</sup></a> The Argives and Æginetans, at one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>period, prohibited the importation of Athenian manufactures,
particularly their pottery, or, at least,
prohibited the use of them in religious ceremonies,
though up to that period they had been allowed.
The object, of course, was to bring their own
earthenware into use, Argos,<a id='r1653' /><a href='#f1653' class='c014'><sup>[1653]</sup></a> especially, possessing
a manufacture which at length rivalled that of
Attica itself. It is regarded as a mark of ancient
simplicity, that neither gold nor silver, nor jewelled
plate, but fictile vases merely, were originally employed
in making libations to the gods.<a id='r1654' /><a href='#f1654' class='c014'><sup>[1654]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The same principles which regulated maritime
commerce governed also the intercourse which nations
carried on by land. It would, therefore, be
unreasonable to look for what is, oddly enough, denominated
“unrestricted freedom,” since, without at
all admitting that “the police mixed itself with
everything,” we cannot deny that the state, in
this, as in all other respects, sought to advance
its own interests. Foolish attempts were sometimes
made to bring down the price of certain necessaries,
as salt, an example of which is mentioned
by Aristophanes; but the law was soon abrogated.<a id='r1655' /><a href='#f1655' class='c014'><sup>[1655]</sup></a>
Had the state been disposed to interfere tyrannically
in anything, it would have been where corn
was concerned. It is, however, admitted by Bœckh,
who has taken the wrong side on this question,
that in this article “we certainly find a great freedom
of prices,” though the law interfered to prevent
the evil consequences to the public of combinations
among corn-dealers for the purpose of
creating a monopoly.<a id='r1656' /><a href='#f1656' class='c014'><sup>[1656]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In general, the business of retail-dealing in the
market was confined by law to the citizens, but
this was not always rigidly enforced, since we find
Egyptians, Phœnicians, and other foreigners, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>their stalls there, for which, it would appear, they
paid a distinct duty.<a id='r1657' /><a href='#f1657' class='c014'><sup>[1657]</sup></a> They were more especially
found among the fishmongers and dealers in small
wares. But, in the Peiræeus, the number of foreign
traders greatly exceeded that of the natives. For
their use, moreover, a species of exchange (δεῖγμα)
was created, whither they brought specimens of
their merchandise for exhibition, the place being
usually crowded with buyers from all the neighbouring
countries. This was, possibly, the most
striking scene in Greece, crowded with merchants
from the East, in their gorgeous and varied costumes,
intermingled with Greeks of all classes,
and gay women who came hither to see and be
seen.<a id='r1658' /><a href='#f1658' class='c014'><sup>[1658]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the prices of things in antiquity, compared
with those at present prevailing, we have only one
way of judging, and that is by ascertaining whether
a greater degree of labour was required to
provide the necessaries of life. The contrary was
certainly the case in Attica, which, nevertheless,
was, probably, the most expensive place of residence
in the world. Even the slaves would appear
to have enjoyed more leisure and exemption from
toil than the industrious classes of our own most
industrious community: and the citizens themselves,
with their numerous festivals and amusements, public
and private, evidently devoted a far greater proportion
of their time to pleasure than would now
be possible to any save the opulent. This, in fact,
resulted from the moderate custom duties charged
by the state, but much more from the superior
fertility of the soil, which yielded greater returns
for less labour, and from the comparative fewness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>of unproductive inhabitants. In modern language,
the supply was greater in proportion to the demand.
Still, it appears quite certain, that, though
the duties laid on by the state were moderate, the
merchants and retail dealers made very great profits.
“This,” as Bœckh observes, “is sufficiently
proved by the high rate of interest on money
lent upon bottomry, in which thirty per cent for
one summer was not unfrequently paid.”<a id='r1659' /><a href='#f1659' class='c014'><sup>[1659]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>I am not quite sure that, as a general rule, “a
high rate of interest and profit is an infallible sign
that industry and trade are yet in their infancy,”
and still less that lowness of interest is a sign of
a flourishing country.<a id='r1660' /><a href='#f1660' class='c014'><sup>[1660]</sup></a> On the contrary, I should
infer, from the former, that trade was in that healthy
state in which it is scarcely a speculation; and,
from the latter, that its current had become stagnant.
However, a high interest was paid, and great
profits were made in antiquity. Of this a striking
example is furnished by Herodotus. A Samian
ship trading with Egypt was, by some accident,
led to push its way westward, as far as Tartessos,
in Iberia, antecedent to the period at which the
Greeks began to trade regularly with that port.<a id='r1661' /><a href='#f1661' class='c014'><sup>[1661]</sup></a>
What the nature and value of its cargo may have
been is not known, any more than the articles which
it received in exchange. The conjecture, however,
that it received silver at a low rate, as the Phœnicians
anciently did, is not improbable. At all events,
the merchants engaged in this adventure cleared
upon that one cargo the sum of sixty talents, of
which, in pious gratitude, they dedicated a tenth to
Hera the tutelar goddess of their island. And this
historian adds, that, with the exception of Sostratos
of Ægina, the most fortunate of mercantile adventurers,
no Grecian merchant had ever up to his
time made so successful a voyage.</p>

country was regarded as extremely
severe by the ancients, so that at
Panticapæum, a city lying between
the modern Kertsh and
Yenikale, neither the myrtle nor
the laurel would grow on account
of the cold, though many attempts
had been made to rear them for
sacred purposes. And yet the
laurel was found to brave the inclemencies
of the season on Mount
Olympos. Most fruit-trees, however,
as apples, pears, figs, and
pomegranates flourished in the
Crimea abundantly, though the
pomegranate required to be covered
in winter, and all fruits ripened
later. The usual timber trees of
the country were the oak, the elm,
and the ash; the pine, the silver-fir,
and the pitch-tree, finding
the climate uncongenial. Theoph.

  <h3 id='ch6.10' class='c012'>CHAPTER X.<br /> NAVIGATION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>As the art of navigation was not invented by the
Greeks, it will be in this place unnecessary to inquire
very minutely into its rude beginnings. Most
maritime tribes doubtless discovered for themselves
the means of traversing such rivers, and creeks, and
bays, and arms of the sea, as lay in their immediate
neighbourhood and impeded their communication,
whether hostile or friendly, with the various tribes
on their borders. Another motive, moreover, which
probably tempted men to trust themselves very early
upon the waters, was the desire to regale on those
dainty fish which abound on nearly all shores, and
constitute among the most savage nations an important
article of food. It will readily be believed
that history cannot pretend to name the individual
who in any country first launched his raft or canoe
upon the deep. Nevertheless, tradition among the
Phœnicians, endeavoured to supply the defect of
history. Ousoös, we are told,<a id='r1662' /><a href='#f1662' class='c014'><sup>[1662]</sup></a> a primitive Arab
hero, observing the trunk of a large tree overthrown,
perhaps by a hurricane, near the shore,
lopped off the branches, set it afloat, and committed
himself along with it to the mercy of the
waves. He had very soon an abundance of imitators.
In every part of the Red Sea, on the Nile,
the Indus, and the Persian Gulf, hardy navigators
made their appearance, who undertook voyages more
or less hazardous, in piraguas constructed of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>single bamboo, or the shell of a vast tortoise, or
of a wicker-work frame covered with leather<a id='r1663' /><a href='#f1663' class='c014'><sup>[1663]</sup></a>—the
coracles of our British ancestors still in common
use on many streams in Wales. Occasionally, too,
more especially on the rivers and shores of the
Euxine, capacious, long, and sturdy barks<a id='r1664' /><a href='#f1664' class='c014'><sup>[1664]</sup></a> were
scooped out of the trunks of enormous trees, which
were denominated Monoxyla, and seem to have
been at one time or another in general use all
over the world from the island of Australasia to
the Arctic Circle. A specimen of those employed
by our own forefathers may be seen in the colonnade
of our national Museum. On the Nile were
several kinds of barks peculiar to Egypt, such for
example, as those which were plaited from the papyrus
plant,<a id='r1665' /><a href='#f1665' class='c014'><sup>[1665]</sup></a> or from rushes. Most extraordinary
of all, however, were their boats of earthenware, in
which, furnished both with sails and oars, they
glided over the serene bosom of the river.</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as the Greeks began to apply themselves
to maritime affairs, they constructed ports
and docks in various parts of the country, where
they built numerous ships, rude enough at first,
perhaps; but improving by experience and study<a id='r1666' /><a href='#f1666' class='c014'><sup>[1666]</sup></a>
they in time equalled, and at length surpassed, the
Phœnicians, by whom at the outset they may perhaps
have been instructed. Among the greatest
difficulties they had to encounter was the scarcity
of ship-timber, for which they were always compelled
greatly to depend on other countries. The
materials, however, being collected, their shipwrights
appear to have proceeded in much the same manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>as those of modern times, laying down the keel,
fixing in the ribs, planking, decking, caulking, and
pitching, until the hull was completed.</p>

<p class='c001'>In their war-galleys,<a id='r1667' /><a href='#f1667' class='c014'><sup>[1667]</sup></a> constructed under the superintendence
of a naval architect elected by lot,
they exhausted all the resources of art in their
endeavours to communicate to them the greatest
beauty of form and splendour of appearance. Painting,
carving, and gilding,<a id='r1668' /><a href='#f1668' class='c014'><sup>[1668]</sup></a> were called in to cover
both stern and prow with images and ornaments
of the most fanciful kinds, glowing with bright
blue or vermilion,<a id='r1669' /><a href='#f1669' class='c014'><sup>[1669]</sup></a> intermingled with scrolls and
flourishes of other colours, and figures of burnished
gold. Occasionally beneath the rim of the
prow were bright cerulean bands,<a id='r1670' /><a href='#f1670' class='c014'><sup>[1670]</sup></a> painted in encaustic
and defended by so durable a varnish that they
could neither be blistered by the sun, nor dimmed
by the action of the sea-water. In this part, beneath
the roots as it were of the acrostolion, were
placed those ornaments resembling eyes, one on
either side, over which the name of the ship was
written.<a id='r1671' /><a href='#f1671' class='c014'><sup>[1671]</sup></a> The sweep of the deck was a gentle
curve, the lowest dip of which was at the ship’s
waist. On the poop stood a deep alcove in which
the pilot took his station,<a id='r1672' /><a href='#f1672' class='c014'><sup>[1672]</sup></a> protected in a great
degree from wind and weather, and having over
his head a large lantern, in which a bright light
was kindled at nightfall.</p>

<p class='c001'>Firm and lofty bulwarks rose along the ship’s
sides, protecting the mariners from being swept
off in tempests by the passing surge. On the bows
again, there was usually a square tower furnished
with lofty portals, through which the combatants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>protected from annoyances on both flanks, poured,
in close fight, their darts into the enemy’s ship,
or rushed forward to board it. At the very front
of the prow, where our bowsprit is now placed,
arose an elegant winding scroll, which though projecting
slightly beyond the hull, could never touch
the corresponding part of the enemy’s galley until
the iron or brazen beaks<a id='r1673' /><a href='#f1673' class='c014'><sup>[1673]</sup></a> below had met and shattered
each other. The rudder<a id='r1674' /><a href='#f1674' class='c014'><sup>[1674]</sup></a> consisted of two
paddles placed one on either side of the ship, which
was impelled along by oar and sail. The row-ports
of these galleys being somewhat capacious
might, if left open, have shipped a great deal of
water, on which account they were furnished with
strong leather bags, in form like a woman’s breast,
projecting outwards, nailed to the circle of the row-port,
and fitting tight about the oar. The rowers,
to render their condition more comfortable, were
furnished with cushions or soft-dressed fleeces.<a id='r1675' /><a href='#f1675' class='c014'><sup>[1675]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The merchantmen differed considerably both in
form and general arrangements from the war-galleys.
As in our own ships of burden, under the
old system of admeasurement, the hull instead of
sinking down sharp towards the keel, bellied outwards
at the sides, so as to render the bottom almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>flat. They were very much shorter, moreover, in
proportion to their height than ships of the line,<a id='r1676' /><a href='#f1676' class='c014'><sup>[1676]</sup></a>
which, from their slender elongated figure, obtained
the appellation of long galleys. In trading vessels,<a id='r1677' /><a href='#f1677' class='c014'><sup>[1677]</sup></a>
much greater stress was laid on sails than on oars,
since the crews could never be sufficiently numerous
to furnish constantly fresh relays of rowers;
and, in their protracted voyages, it would have been
impossible for the same men to remain perpetually
on the benches. The masts consequently were here
of very great height, equalling, according to rule, the
length of the ship, which rendered it practicable
to crowd an immense quantity of canvass, but at
the same time rendered them liable to capsize in
a heavy gale, as is still the case with the Levant-built
ships, which are generally much taller rigged
than ours. They commonly gave a greater length
to the hull of transports, though not altogether so
great as to ships of war. Pirate luggers were always
built without decks,<a id='r1678' /><a href='#f1678' class='c014'><sup>[1678]</sup></a> and extremely low that
they might be the better able to approach their
prey unperceived. Their sloops, smacks, and lighters,<a id='r1679' /><a href='#f1679' class='c014'><sup>[1679]</sup></a>
together with all the other small craft employed
in the coasting trade, exhibited every variety
of form, but appear to have been generally stout-built
and well-appointed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting the tonnage and dimensions of the
largest class of merchantmen, we possess little positive
information. It would appear, however, that
in comparison with the vessels engaged in the corn-trade,
between Alexandria and Italy,<a id='r1680' /><a href='#f1680' class='c014'><sup>[1680]</sup></a> they were of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>very moderate burden, since the appearance of one
of those large ships in the Peiræeus excited general
astonishment. The size of this Egyptian trader, which
seems to have been no way distinguished from others
engaged in the same traffic, may perhaps assist the
imagination in forming some definite idea of an
ancient merchantman: its length, from stem to stern,
was one hundred and eighty feet, its breadth nearly
fifty, and its clear depth in the hold about forty-five.
It was furnished with one enormous mast,
with yards in proportion, and a capacious mainsail,
composed of numerous tiers of ox-hides. The cables
and anchors, capstains, windlasses, with all the other
appurtenances of a ship, were on a suitable scale,
while the crew was so numerous as to be compared
to an army. In the stem were airy and spacious
cabins, above which rose the gilded figure of a
goose. On either side of the bows stood an image
of Isis,<a id='r1681' /><a href='#f1681' class='c014'><sup>[1681]</sup></a> bending over the waves and appearing to
afford her divine protection to those who had chosen
her for their tutelar goddess. Among the Greeks,
however, the place assigned to the tutelar divinity
was sometimes the stern, where oaths were taken,
expiations made, prayers and sacrifices offered up,
and where such of the crew as had committed any
offence took sanctuary. On the top of the mast
was a vane<a id='r1682' /><a href='#f1682' class='c014'><sup>[1682]</sup></a> of burnished metal which, turning and
flashing in the sun, appeared like a streak of flame.
As their ships, more especially during long voyages,
ran perpetual risk of being assailed by pirates, they
were abundantly supplied with all kinds of arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>and implements of war, which were ranged along
the cabin partitions and elsewhere with so much
order and regularity, that they could always, by night
or day, be found at a moment’s warning.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was by very slow advances that the ancients
arrived at that high degree of excellence in the
art of ship-building, which, in the most flourishing
ages of Greece, its maritime states exhibited. In
the Homeric age, the largest vessels known were
of very moderate burden, since even the poet, who
would doubtless allow himself some licence, speaks
of no transport which could carry more than one
hundred and fifty men. These barks, too, Thucydides
thinks, were undecked, like the pirate vessels
of his own times, and indeed in ours also, in most
parts of the Ægæan, though I have myself sailed
in a large Greek brig, of piratical construction, which
carried several guns, and was not only decked, but
so admirably built, that after labouring ten days in
a storm, she made not an inch more water than
when in port.</p>

<p class='c001'>The various stages in improvement have not been
marked. They went on, however, each age excelling
that which had preceded it, until at length
having reached the utmost perfection of which their
system was susceptible, they began to apply their
skill to the creation of huge fabrics merely for show
and magnificence, and calculated rather for the gratification
of an insane luxury than for the genuine
purposes of trade. One of these naval monsters
was constructed at Syracuse under the eye of Archimedes,
and at the expense of king Hiero.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having procured from the forests of Mount Ætna
timber sufficient for the building of sixty triremes,
together with a variety of other materials from Italy,
Spain, and Gaul, as crooked timber for ribs, hard wood
for pegs, with pitch and hemp, and Spanish broom<a id='r1683' /><a href='#f1683' class='c014'><sup>[1683]</sup></a>
for cables, he assembled a sufficient number of ship-wrights,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>with Archias, the Corinthian, at their head,
and set them to work under the inspection of Archimedes,
though he himself spent the greater part of
his day overlooking the workmen at the dock. When
in about six months the planking had been carried
to about half the height of the hull, and properly
sheathed with lead in lieu of the copper at present
employed, the ship was launched<a id='r1684' /><a href='#f1684' class='c014'><sup>[1684]</sup></a> by means of a
machine, invented for the purpose by Archimedes,
into a sort of floating dock, where it was completed
in other six months. The planks were fastened to
the ribs with copper bolts, of which some were of
ten and others fifteen pounds’ weight, passed through
holes prepared for them by the auger; and over
the heads of these bolts plates of lead were fixed,
having been first lined, as it were, with a layer of wadding
steeped in pitch.</p>

<p class='c001'>They next proceeded to the interior arrangements,
the explanation of which is replete with difficulty.
The whole depth of the ship seems to have been
divided into four stories, of which the lowest, or
hold, was filled by the cargo; the second, descended to
by long flights of steps, was appropriated to the rowers,
who were ranged in twenty banks; the third
was laid out in cabins for the use of the crew, while
the military officers and the men occupied the uppermost.
The kitchen was situated in the stern.</p>

<p class='c001'>All these cabins were adorned with pavements in
mosaic, representing in a long series of compartments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>the entire action of the Iliad; while the furniture,
doors, and ceilings were furnished with proportionate
splendour and elegance. On the upper deck was a
gymnasium, exactly proportioned to the dimensions
of the ship, together with a number of walks running
through the midst of gardens laid out on leaden
terraces, and containing all kinds of odoriferous plants
and flowers. All these alleys were arched with trellis-work,
overlaid with the intermingled foliage of the
white-ivy and the vine growing out of troughs filled
with earth, arranged along the promenades, and
watered like other gardens. In a different part of
the ship was a magnificent apartment called the
Aphrodision, furnished with three couches, and having
a pavement variegated with agates, and all the
richest and most beautiful marbles of Sicily. It was
wainscotted and roofed with cypress, while its doors
were of Atlantic citron-wood inlaid with ivory. On
all sides, moreover, it was adorned with pictures
and statues and vases and goblets, of the most fanciful
and varied forms. Contiguous to this chamber
was the library, furnished with five couches and store
of books. Its doors and wainscot were of box, and
on its roof was a sun-dial, constructed in imitation
of that in the Achradina. There was also a bath,
in which were three couches, and three caldaria of
bronze, together with a basin containing five metretæ,
lined with Taurominian marble of various colours.
There were numerous cabins fitted up for the soldiers
and the crew, from whom was selected a number of
persons whose sole business it was to superintend the
pumps.<a id='r1685' /><a href='#f1685' class='c014'><sup>[1685]</sup></a> The ship likewise contained twenty stables,
ten on either hand, well supplied with fodder, and
every convenience for the grooms.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the bows was a prodigious reservoir of fresh-water,
lined with tarpaulin, and kept under lock and
key; and near it lay the piscina or fish-pond, overlaid
with lead, and filled with sea-water, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>was preserved an ample supply of fish for a long
voyage. On projecting galleries, extending along the
ship’s sides, were situated the wood-house, the kitchen,
the bake-house, the mills, and other conveniences.
At different distances along the sides were ranged
numerous figures of Atlas, nine feet in height, supporting
the triglyphs and the projecting portions of
the ship: its whole surface, moreover, was adorned
with suitable paintings.</p>

<p class='c001'>There arose from the deck eight towers, two on
the stern, two on the prow, and four in the ship’s
waist, in diameter and elevation proportioned to the
dimensions of the whole. From the outer battlements
of each of these turrets projected two immense
beams, hollowed out like troughs, which being balanced
in the middle on the edge of the tower,
could be filled with huge stones, that, by elevating
the inner extremity of the machine, were launched
into the enemy’s ship as it sailed beneath. These
engines were probably worked by ropes and pulleys
attached to the opposite battlements. Six armed
men, two of whom were archers, took their station
in each turret, the whole interior of which was filled
with stones and darts. All round the ship, supported
by a series of triangles, ran a gallery, defended by
a parapet and battlements. On this stood a catapult,
invented by Archimedes, which cast darts eighteen
feet long, with stones upwards of three hundred
and fifty pounds in weight, to the distance of a furlong.
This gallery, as well, I presume, as the men
who worked the engine, was protected by a close
net-work of large ropes suspended from brazen chains.
To each of the three masts was attached a couple
of engines, which darted iron bars and masses of
lead against the enemy. The sides of the ship
bristled with iron spikes, designed to protect it
against boarding; and on all sides were likewise
grapples, which could be flung by machines into the
galleys of the foe, so as to retain them within reach
of the missiles from on board. Along the galleries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>and round the masts and catapults, were drawn up
two hundred and forty men in complete armour. In
the fore, main, and mizen-tops were stationed other
warriors, who were supplied with stones and similar
missiles by baskets running on pulleys, and worked
by boys. The ship was supplied with twelve anchors,
of which four were of wood, and eight of iron.<a id='r1686' /><a href='#f1686' class='c014'><sup>[1686]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Very little difficulty was experienced in discovering
pines sufficiently lofty for the fore and mizen-masts
of this huge galley; but it was only by accident
that a swineherd in the mountains of the Abruzzi
found a tree of sufficient magnitude for the mainmast.
It was conveyed to the sea by Philias, an
engineer of Taurominium. The pump, notwithstanding
its great depth, was easily worked by the screw
of Archimedes, and only required the labour of one
individual. The name first bestowed on this ship
by Hiero was “The Syracusan;” but when afterwards
he despatched it as a present to King Ptolemy,
he changed it to that of the “The Alexandrian.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides the individuals already enumerated, there
were six hundred men stationed on the prow; and
to administer justice in this floating commonwealth
a court was instituted, consisting of the captain,
the pilot, and the principal officers in command in
the forecastle, who judged according to the laws of
Syracuse. It was followed on the voyage to Egypt
by a number of smaller craft, of which the majority
were fishing-smacks.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cargo of “The Alexandrian,” which, together
with the vessel itself, was presented to King Ptolemy
at a time when famine raged in Egypt, consisted
of sixty thousand medimni of corn, two thousand
jars of salt-fish, twenty thousand talents of wool, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>an equal quantity of other commodities. The poet
Archimelos having written a copy of verses on this
nautical castle, Hiero felt so greatly flattered by the
compliment that he sent the author a thousand
medimni of wheat, which he landed for him at the
Peiræeus.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to convey some idea of another department
of nautical architecture among the ancients,
in which there was probably a greater display of
fancy than of science, we shall here introduce the
description of a pleasure-barge in which Ptolemy
Philopater and the ladies of his court used to sail
upon the Nile.<a id='r1687' /><a href='#f1687' class='c014'><sup>[1687]</sup></a> Among the caliphs and sultans of
the East we find traces of a similar taste for gorgeous
and magnificent barks; but neither in history
nor fiction do we remember to have met any account
of a vessel so curiously constructed, or so superbly
and sumptuously adorned. It was, in the first place,
half a furlong in length, flat-bottomed, and rising
high above the water on account of the swell, with
projecting keel, and prow of most graceful curvature,—or,
I should rather, perhaps, say, prows, for it
appeared double in front, as though a pair of galleys
had been lashed together. Along the sides and stern
ran two galleries, the one above the other, where
the persons on board might stroll and take exercise
as the barge was wafted along by the wind. Of
these the lower one resembled an open peristyle, the
upper a close arcade furnished at intervals with windows
looking out upon the river.</p>

<p class='c001'>Considering the whole barge as one great building,
the architect placed the extreme hall encircled
by a single row of columns at the extremity
of the stern, where it was, doubtless, approached
from the upper gallery. Having traversed this,
you next beheld a propylæon erected with the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>precious wood and ivory. This led into a proscenion
roofed over, in the vicinity of which lay a
variety of chambers. Of these the most remarkable
was a vast peripheral hall fitted up with
twenty couches. This apartment was wainscotted
with cedar and Milesian cypress; the doors, twenty
in number, were formed of panels of citron wood
richly inlaid with ivory. The hinges, the nails, the
knockers, and door-handles, were of copper, gilt.
The shafts of the columns were cypress wood, and
the Corinthian capitals of gold and ivory were surmounted
by an architrave richly overlaid with gold.
Above this again was a broad frieze adorned with
numerous figures of animals roughly sculptured in
ivory, but remarkable for the costliness of the materials.
The ceiling was of cedar wood elaborately
carved and covered with a blaze of gilding. Close
at hand were the apartments of the women, in the
structure and ornaments of which equal magnificence
was displayed. In another part of the bark
was a chapel of Aphroditè surmounted by a dome.
It contained a statue of the goddess in Parian
marble. This sacred edifice was surrounded by
other suites of apartments among which was a
symposion adorned with pillars of Indian marble.
Towards the prow was a saloon sacred to Dionysos,
surrounded on all sides with pillars furnished with
numerous couches, and adorned with gilded cornices.
The roof was enriched with ornaments suited
to the character of the god, that is, in all probability
orgeastic processions of Bacchantes and Bacchanals,
with crowns of ivy and vine leaves. On
the right hand this saloon opened into a grotto or
cavern, in which the colours of rocks were imitated
by an incrustation of precious stones, whose brilliance
was in various parts relieved by ornaments
of gold. The busts of the royal family sculptured
of Parian marble were ranged round the grot.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the roof of the great saloon was erected a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>small symposion, in the form of a tent, exceedingly
agreeable from its airiness and the fine prospect
it commanded over the whole valley of the
Nile. It was completely open in front, and the
roof consisting of a series of semicircular hoops
like the top of a calèche, it could be bent down
and drawn forward at pleasure, and was covered
with purple hangings. By a winding staircase constructed
in a different part of the bark, you ascended
to another hall, constructed and decorated
after the Egyptian manner, being adorned with a
number of round pillars composed of a succession
of blocks of equal height, alternately white and
black. Their capitals, likewise were round, but
contracting rather than expanding at the top like
an elongated rose-bud.</p>

<p class='c001'>In all this part of the column, technically denominated
calathos, there were neither volutes nor rows
of open and projecting foliage as in Greek architecture,
but bells of the river lotos, or other
flowers, intermingled with newly formed fruit of
the date palm. To correspond with these columns,
the walls of Egyptian edifices were frequently
lined with black and white slabs alternating
with each other. Of these the white were
sometimes of alabaster.</p>

<p class='c001'>This bark was furnished with but one mast, one
hundred and five feet in height, to which was fitted
a single sail of byssus with purple fringe. The dimensions
of the sail must, however, have been
prodigious, but from the fineness of its fabric it
could never have been hoisted in rough weather.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we turn now to the materials wherewith the
ships of the ancients were constructed we shall find
that they here differed as much from the practice
of modern nations, at least in the north, as in the
form and style of rigging. With us scarcely anything
but oak or teak is employed in those parts
which come in contact with the water, whereas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>the Greeks constructed their war galleys, in which
speed was of the greatest moment, of fir,<a id='r1688' /><a href='#f1688' class='c014'><sup>[1688]</sup></a> while
they chiefly made use of pitch pine in the building
of merchantmen, as that wood long resists the
corrosive action of the sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Cypriotes appear in all cases to have given
the preference to the pine which abounds in the
island, and was esteemed superior to the pitch
tree,<a id='r1689' /><a href='#f1689' class='c014'><sup>[1689]</sup></a> though the latter was sometimes appropriated
to the building of ships of war. Among the Syrians
and Phœnicians, in whose country a supply
of pine was not to be obtained,<a id='r1690' /><a href='#f1690' class='c014'><sup>[1690]</sup></a> the custom prevailed
of building ships entirely of cedar.<a id='r1691' /><a href='#f1691' class='c014'><sup>[1691]</sup></a> The
practice of employing oak<a id='r1692' /><a href='#f1692' class='c014'><sup>[1692]</sup></a> had, likewise, already
been introduced, though it does not appear to have
been common; but in the larger classes of ships
the keel was always of that timber, in order that,
when drawn on shore, it might be able to sustain
the weight of the superincumbent mass. In the
holcades or merchantmen, the keel, like the ship
itself, was of pitch pine; but all such vessels were
in those days supplied with a false keel, called
chelysma,<a id='r1693' /><a href='#f1693' class='c014'><sup>[1693]</sup></a> of oak, or oxya, designed to act as a protection
when they were drawn up into dry dock.
Masts and yards were commonly of the silver fir;<a id='r1694' /><a href='#f1694' class='c014'><sup>[1694]</sup></a>
oars of such timber as grew on the northern slopes
of mountains.<a id='r1695' /><a href='#f1695' class='c014'><sup>[1695]</sup></a> The turned work used in ornamenting
the interior was commonly of mulberry, ash,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>elm, or platane wood, of which the last was least
esteemed.<a id='r1696' /><a href='#f1696' class='c014'><sup>[1696]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Sails were made and manufactured from a variety
of materials. It has been seen above, in speaking
of the Egyptian war ships, that they sometimes consisted
of a number of hides sown together. They
were, likewise, in various countries, plaited, as now
in China,<a id='r1697' /><a href='#f1697' class='c014'><sup>[1697]</sup></a> from reeds, or rushes, but the sailcloth
of the Greeks was generally, like our own, woven
from hemp.<a id='r1698' /><a href='#f1698' class='c014'><sup>[1698]</sup></a> For this, in Egypt, the papyrus was
sometimes substituted. Princes and grandees occasionally,
in their pleasure-boats, employed, in lieu
of these rude materials, cotton or fine linen, dyed, to
augment their beauty, of the most brilliant purple.
To this Shakespeare alludes in the following passage,
which though familiar, perhaps, to the reader,
I must, nevertheless, beg permission to quote:</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>An ancient anonymous writer on the art military
describes a vessel closely resembling our steamboats
in construction, but in which bullocks, stationed
in the hold, worked the paddle-wheels instead
of an engine. It flew along the water, says
the author, without oars or sails, simply by the
impulses of wheels, which, rising partly above the
waves, operated, when in action, like a succession
of oars.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ropes and cables<a id='r1700' /><a href='#f1700' class='c014'><sup>[1700]</sup></a> were manufactured in antiquity
from a great variety of materials. At first,
the cordage most in use would appear to have been
composed of twisted thongs; for which, in process
of time, was substituted goats’ hair,<a id='r1701' /><a href='#f1701' class='c014'><sup>[1701]</sup></a> the Spanish
broom,<a id='r1702' /><a href='#f1702' class='c014'><sup>[1702]</sup></a> the bark of the cornel<a id='r1703' /><a href='#f1703' class='c014'><sup>[1703]</sup></a> and linden-tree,<a id='r1704' /><a href='#f1704' class='c014'><sup>[1704]</sup></a>
with byblos, hemp,<a id='r1705' /><a href='#f1705' class='c014'><sup>[1705]</sup></a> and flax.<a id='r1706' /><a href='#f1706' class='c014'><sup>[1706]</sup></a> The enormous cables
which supported the bridge thrown by Xerxes
over the Hellespont were manufactured from mixed
materials, of which two-thirds were byblos and one-third
white flax.<a id='r1707' /><a href='#f1707' class='c014'><sup>[1707]</sup></a> They were of dimensions so vast
that a piece half a yard in length weighed one
hundred and twenty-five pounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the sailors, upon whose energy, skill, and courage,
the success of every voyage necessarily depended,
ancient writers have been more than usually
scanty in their communications. We know, however,
that the mariners as well on board the merchantmen
of Athens as those of the other states of Greece,
were partly citizens, partly strangers, and in many
instances slaves. Leading a life full of hardship
and danger, engaged as it were in a perpetual conflict
with the elements, their tempers grew fierce,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>their manners boisterous and rude,<a id='r1708' /><a href='#f1708' class='c014'><sup>[1708]</sup></a> and their morals
none of the most elevated. During the intervals
they spent on shore, they endeavoured by snatching
at all the coarse pleasures within their reach,
to make themselves some amends for their habitual
privations. The excuse, however, for this conduct
was often sophistically borrowed from religion,
for during the prevalence of storms at sea, it was
customary to make vows to Poseidon, or Castor and
Polydeukes, or some of the other patrons of the
nautical art; and on reaching port the victims were
slain and offered up, and the sacrifice of necessity
was accompanied by a feast. To these their boon
companions, dancing-girls, female flute-players, hetairæ,
jugglers, and low parasites, were invited, and
the whole usually terminated in excessive intoxication
and a battle royal. Most mariners were attached
to some dame of equivocal reputation in the
Peiræeus or elsewhere, to whom on their return
from voyages they were in the habit of bringing
presents, such as a pair of gilded slippers, a dainty
cheese, a jar of pickles, or saltfish, or a measure or
two of onions. What was the amount of wages,
which enabled them to indulge in this kind of
liberality, I have nowhere been able to discover,
though in all probability it was at least equal to
the pay received by seamen in the war-galleys, that
is from three to four oboloi a-day. Their operations
while on board, were regulated of course by circumstances
and the accidents of the weather. Thus,
when the breeze was strong and favourable, they
might lounge or sit about the decks, or sleep, during
the greater part of the twenty-four hours,
without shifting a sail or handling an oar, though
a man was always stationed at the prow to keep a
sharp look-out, and watch the aspect of the sky.<a id='r1709' /><a href='#f1709' class='c014'><sup>[1709]</sup></a>
In calms, however, or when the swell and roar of the
sea foretold an approaching tempest, the whole crew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>took to their cushions, and raising at the command
of the boatswain,<a id='r1710' /><a href='#f1710' class='c014'><sup>[1710]</sup></a> a loud chant,<a id='r1711' /><a href='#f1711' class='c014'><sup>[1711]</sup></a> which contended
in volume with the angry voice of the ocean,
they strained every nerve to augment the velocity
of their bark, and gain some friendly port before
the storm fairly set in. Occasionally, however, they
were overtaken by tempests in the neighbourhood
of rocky islands or bleak and inhospitable promontories
like the Chelidonian rocks, where from whatever
point of the compass the wind might blow a
heavy surge beat upon the shore perpetually. Under
these circumstances it was observed, more especially
during the darkness of the night, that two brilliant
glancing lights played evermore about the masts
and yards, shooting hither and thither, and kindling
up the crest of the surge by their luminous
appearance. These were the Dioscuri, the tender
and affectionate brothers of Helen, whose benevolence
towards mankind in general was only to be
equalled by their attachment to each other. When
matters came to extremities and the waves appeared
ready to engulf both crew and passengers, all on
board became keenly sensible to the irregularities
of their past lives, and the whispered interrogation
passed round the bark: “have you been initiated?”
Because those to whom the truths treasured up in
the sanctuary of Eleusis had been revealed, were
supposed to be better prepared than other men for
meeting death, and appearing at the judgment-seat
of heaven. It was now that vows and prayers were
heard, and that feelings of repentance were sincere,
and it would have required a more than ordinary
degree of apathy to forget such circumstances when,
by an unlooked-for interposition of Providence,
they were snatched from the jaws of death, and
restored to their kindred and their homes. We may
remark here, by the way, that, to passengers labouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>under the effects of sea-sickness, a decoction
of a species of thyme<a id='r1712' /><a href='#f1712' class='c014'><sup>[1712]</sup></a> (thymum tragoriganum)
was administered.</p>

<p class='c001'>In their political predilections,<a id='r1713' /><a href='#f1713' class='c014'><sup>[1713]</sup></a> the mariners of
Greece were almost invariably observed to be democratic,
probably because being possessed of superior
energy they naturally spurned all control
save that of the laws, and were ready at all times
and under all circumstances to contend for liberty.
This was more especially the case with the Athenian
seamen, who, in the flourishing periods of Hellenic
history bore much the same relation to the
other seafarers of Greece, as the sailors of England
do to those of the neighbouring European states.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the mariners’ compass had not yet
been invented, the ancient sailors did not, as appears
to be generally supposed, creep timidly from
headland to headland along the shore, but traversed
boldly the open sea, directing their course by the
constellations, more particularly that of the greater
bear. In this practice the Arabs of Phœnicia led
the way as in most other early improvements connected
with seamanship.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is sometimes believed that, in very remote
ages, mankind possessed no names for the winds,<a id='r1714' /><a href='#f1714' class='c014'><sup>[1714]</sup></a>
because as they had not yet addicted themselves to
navigation, it concerned them very little to observe
how or which way they blew. Possibly, however,
we somewhat exaggerate the heedlessness and ignorance
of the remoter generations of men who
must have been singularly obtuse in their intellect
if they could not tell whether the wind blew up
or down a valley, or on the back or front of their
houses, and had failed to designate the several
currents of the atmosphere by distinct appellations,
whereby to distinguish them when they had occasion
to speak of their effects. About the period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>of the Trojan war some inventive genius sprang
up who gave a name to the north and the south
winds, and already in the time of Homer the
Greeks had contrived to have four points to their
compass, at least the poet speaks but of the four
cardinal winds, Boreas, the north; Euros, the east;
Notos, the south, and Zephyros, the west. To
these other four were afterwards added, and at
the same time some change was introduced into
the ancient nomenclature, the north-east was called
Cæcias;<a id='r1715' /><a href='#f1715' class='c014'><sup>[1715]</sup></a> the south-east, Euros; the name of the
east being changed to Apeliotes; the south-west,
Libs; the north-west, Argestes, and sometimes
Olympias,<a id='r1716' /><a href='#f1716' class='c014'><sup>[1716]</sup></a> or Iapyx, or Sciron; which, however,
according to Pliny differed from the Argestes, and
was peculiar to Athens. These are the winds represented
on the tower of Andronicos Cyrrhestes at
Athens, spoken of by Varro, Vitruvius,<a id='r1717' /><a href='#f1717' class='c014'><sup>[1717]</sup></a> and many
modern travellers. Pliny,<a id='r1718' /><a href='#f1718' class='c014'><sup>[1718]</sup></a> Galen, and Aulus Gellius
differ from Aristotle in confining the name of
Aparctias to the north wind, and giving that of
Boreas to the north-east, or Aquilo of the Romans.<a id='r1719' /><a href='#f1719' class='c014'><sup>[1719]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Winds blowing from the northern points of the
compass are most frequent in Greece. Aristotle<a id='r1720' /><a href='#f1720' class='c014'><sup>[1720]</sup></a>
remarks, that Boreas is strong at its commencement,
but feeble towards its close; and that of
the south wind, the reverse is true.<a id='r1721' /><a href='#f1721' class='c014'><sup>[1721]</sup></a> It may, moreover,
be added, that the north wind was not only
the most common, but also the dryest and most
severe, though sometimes accompanied by lightning,
and hail, and snow. The same wind brought rain
on the Hellespont, and at Cyrenè. The Cæcias
commonly prevailed about the vernal equinox, and,
in Attica and the islands, was a rainy wind;<a id='r1722' /><a href='#f1722' class='c014'><sup>[1722]</sup></a> the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Apetiotes was a humid but soft wind felt chiefly
in the morning.<a id='r1723' /><a href='#f1723' class='c014'><sup>[1723]</sup></a> The Euros, which, as Gœttling<a id='r1724' /><a href='#f1724' class='c014'><sup>[1724]</sup></a>
observes, is the Scirocco of the Italians, prevails
about the winter solstice, and at first is
warm and dry, but afterwards by blowing long over
the sea becomes moist, and brings rain, particularly
in Lesbos.<a id='r1725' /><a href='#f1725' class='c014'><sup>[1725]</sup></a> Aristotle, however, speaks of the Notos
as the chief rainy wind in this island,<a id='r1726' /><a href='#f1726' class='c014'><sup>[1726]</sup></a> and observes
what I have myself verified in the Delta,
that during the Simoom objects appear greater than
their natural size.<a id='r1727' /><a href='#f1727' class='c014'><sup>[1727]</sup></a> The Notos blows chiefly about
the end of autumn in Greece, as I found it also
on the Nile immediately after the winter solstice,
and at the commencement of spring.<a id='r1728' /><a href='#f1728' class='c014'><sup>[1728]</sup></a> It likewise
prevails during the dog-days<a id='r1729' /><a href='#f1729' class='c014'><sup>[1729]</sup></a> (ἐπὶ κυνὶ). Naturally
moist and warm, it was at first weak, but grew
powerful as it drew towards its end, when it covered
the sky with clouds and ended in rain.<a id='r1730' /><a href='#f1730' class='c014'><sup>[1730]</sup></a>
South winds blowing from the sea, by which they
were cooled, were considered favourable to vegetation
particularly in the Thriasian plain in Attica,
lying between the Sciros and the Cephissos. These
same winds were supposed to be cold in Libya;
I think erroneously, since the south winds are warm
in Egypt. The Libs is moist and cloudy, though
less so than the Cæcias; but the clouds which it
brings are quickly dispersed; it blows chiefly about
Cnidos and Rhodes.<a id='r1731' /><a href='#f1731' class='c014'><sup>[1731]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Zephyr<a id='r1732' /><a href='#f1732' class='c014'><sup>[1732]</sup></a> which prevails in the spring, at mid-summer
and in autumn is felt chiefly in the evening
and never in the morning. According to Aristotle
it is the gentlest wind that blows.<a id='r1733' /><a href='#f1733' class='c014'><sup>[1733]</sup></a> Theophrastus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>however, remarks, that it is cold in some countries,
though less so than Boreas;<a id='r1734' /><a href='#f1734' class='c014'><sup>[1734]</sup></a> but in the opinion of
Hippocrates, it is most of all winds charged with
rain.<a id='r1735' /><a href='#f1735' class='c014'><sup>[1735]</sup></a> The Argestos is no less dry and serene than
the Aparctias, though it sometimes brings thunder-clouds
and hail.<a id='r1736' /><a href='#f1736' class='c014'><sup>[1736]</sup></a> This wind is remarkably cold at
Chalcis in Eub&oelig;a. When about the winter solstice
it happens to blow, it dries up and withers the
trees more than long continued heats and droughts.<a id='r1737' /><a href='#f1737' class='c014'><sup>[1737]</sup></a>
At Rhodes and at Cnidos it is usually accompanied
by heavy clouds.<a id='r1738' /><a href='#f1738' class='c014'><sup>[1738]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Etesian winds which commence immediately
after the summer solstice, and continue through
the dog-days, are in reality northern winds, but occasionally
point obliquely both towards the west and
towards the east. They prevail chiefly at night;<a id='r1739' /><a href='#f1739' class='c014'><sup>[1739]</sup></a>
and are sometimes exceedingly powerful on the coast
of Egypt.<a id='r1740' /><a href='#f1740' class='c014'><sup>[1740]</sup></a> Another class of Etesian winds prevailed
earlier in the year, beginning about twenty days after
the winter solstice. These are weaker, more variable,
and of briefer duration than the real Etesian winds,
and I will add, from my own experience, cover
the sky with dark clouds, and blow extremely cold
even along the shores of Marmarica and Cyrenè.
In ancient Greece they obtained the name of Ornithiæ—“the
Bird Winds”—because they announced
the return of the birds.<a id='r1741' /><a href='#f1741' class='c014'><sup>[1741]</sup></a> Or, according
to another version of the matter, because they were
so cold as to strike dead various kinds of birds
during their flight, and strew the earth with their
bodies.<a id='r1742' /><a href='#f1742' class='c014'><sup>[1742]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>During the winter months these cold and piercing
winds blow with so much fury over the land-locked
seas and islands of Greece, that among the ancients
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>all navigation was suspended during the brumal season.
In proof of the violence of these aërial currents,
which may almost be said to set steadily in
one direction through a great portion of the year, it
may be observed, that in several of the islands neither
vines nor fig-trees can be trained upright, but are
blown down and compelled to creep along the
rocks.<a id='r1743' /><a href='#f1743' class='c014'><sup>[1743]</sup></a> An example of the strength of the gales
which sometimes also prevail on the Hellenic continent
is recorded in history; during the retreat of
Cleombrotos out of Bœotia, his army being overtaken
by a storm as it was traversing the mountain passes
leading from Creusis to Ægosthena along the shore
of the sea, numerous sumpter asses were blown
with their ladings over the precipices; even the
shields and arms were in many cases whirled from
the hands of the soldiers and precipitated into the
waves below; and to prevent similar misfortune
the rest of the army turned their bucklers upside
down and filled them with stones, while they pushed
forward, divested of defensive armour, into the Megaris,
a friendly country, from which they afterwards
returned and fetched off their shields.<a id='r1744' /><a href='#f1744' class='c014'><sup>[1744]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In cases of shipwreck the protection afforded to
crews and merchandise depended in most cases, perhaps,
on the character and progress of civilisation
of the people on whose shore the accident happened.
On the coast of Thrace, in the neighbourhood of
Salmydessos, where the whole maritime population
appear to have been confirmed wreckers, numerous
pillars were set up along the beach to mark the
limits within which each little community might
claim whatever booty was drifted in by the sea.
Previous to this arrangement, the barbarians used
frequently to come to blows in the eager pursuit
of this inhuman calling, and in these brawls many
lives were lost. Afterwards they appear to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>carried on their war against distressed mariners
with perfect harmony and equanimity.<a id='r1745' /><a href='#f1745' class='c014'><sup>[1745]</sup></a> But among
the Rhodians, an enterprising mercantile people, the
amount of salvage was regulated by a law which,
together with the rest of their commercial code,
was afterwards adopted by the Romans.</p>

<p class='c001'>If gold, or silver, or any other article, be brought
up from the depth of eight cubits, the person who
saves it shall receive one-third. If from fifteen
cubits, the person who saves it shall, on account
of the depth, receive one-half. If goods are cast
up by the waves towards the shore, and found sunk
at the depth of one cubit, the person who carries
them out safe shall receive a tenth part.<a id='r1746' /><a href='#f1746' class='c014'><sup>[1746]</sup></a> It was
customary, moreover, in old times, to keep a number
of divers on board ships for the purpose of
descending to loosen the anchors when they chanced
to take too firm a hold in the sand, as also to
recover goods which had been thrown overboard
in times of danger.<a id='r1747' /><a href='#f1747' class='c014'><sup>[1747]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On various headlands and promontories of the
ancient world beacon-fires were habitually kindled to
guide the course of the ships into port; and for
these, in after ages, light-houses, adorned with every
beauty of architecture, and carried to a vast height,
were substituted. Of these the most remarkable
was that erected for Ptolemy Philadelphus, by Sostratos,
the Cnidian, whose name, by permission of
the king, was inscribed upon the structure.<a id='r1748' /><a href='#f1748' class='c014'><sup>[1748]</sup></a> By
one author it is described as four hundred and fifty
feet high, and equal in dimensions at the base to
one of the great pyramids of Memphis. In form
it may possibly have resembled the Haram el
Kedâb, which consists of a series of square
towers from the basement upwards, diminishing
in size, and appearing to spring up out of each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>other. With this the language of Strabo<a id='r1749' /><a href='#f1749' class='c014'><sup>[1749]</sup></a> very
well agrees, since he tells us, it was a building
consisting of numerous stages. On the summit
bright fires were kept perpetually burning, so that
on that low shore, where there is no hill or mountain
for many days’ journey, the Pharos was ever
the first object which presented itself to mariners
at sea, where its light, we are told, was
visible at the distance of a hundred miles. Occasionally,
however, from its great size and brilliance,
it was mistaken for the moon, as this planet
itself, rising behind the dome and towers of
a great capital, has suggested to distant beholders
the idea of a conflagration.<a id='r1750' /><a href='#f1750' class='c014'><sup>[1750]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1675'>1675</a>. The sea-term ὑπηρέσιον which
occurs in Thucydides, ii. 93, is
very variously explained. Mitford
(Hist. Greece, iii. 154) contends,
that it means a sort of bag
placed in the τρῆμα, or aperture
through which the oar passed,
and was designed to prevent the
flowing in of the waves. This
bag, however, as I have already
remarked in pp. 289, 290,
was called ἄσκωμα. Poll. ii. 154.
Potter (ii. 136,) thinks it was
a skin on which the rowers sat.
Lilius Gyraldus, (De Navigiis, c.
vi. p. 627,) supposes it to have
been that part of the galley on
which the oar rested, and sometimes
signified the oar itself. The
Greek scholiast on Thucydides,
(t. v. p. 399,) agrees with Potter,
saying, that it means a sheep-skin
with the fleece which covered
the rowers’ benches.</p>

I have nowhere discovered.
Those which take place on the
occasion in modern Greece are extremely
pleasing, and may, perhaps,
have had a classical origin.
A crown of flowers “is suspended
from the prow of a vessel
when it is first launched, and
the ‘καρόβακηρι,’ or master of
the ship, raises the jar of wine
to his lips as he stands upon
the deck, and then pours it on
the ground. Surely, nothing
can be more beautifully classical;
and it were to be wished
that we could trace some part
of a ceremony that takes place
with us upon the same occasion
to this source, and not consider
it as an imitation of one of the
most sacred rites of our religion.”

  <h3 id='ch6.11' class='c012'>CHAPTER XI. <br />EXPORTS AND IMPORTS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Although we have above glanced slightly at the
exports and imports of Athens and several other
states, we ought here perhaps to enter into greater
detail, for the purpose of rendering as complete as
possible our idea of the vigorous and extensive
commerce carried on by the Greeks. It will not
of course be understood, that all the articles enumerated
in the present chapters constituted at any
one time the floating materials of Hellenic trade;
the probability being, that some grew out of fashion
and were succeeded by others, for which at a later
period they may again have been substituted. But
the mind must suppose itself to be dealing with
the whole extent of authentic Grecian history,
within the limits of which it will be found, that
everything we here mention was trafficked in, though
it seems to be now impossible to observe in these
matters a strict chronology and fix the epoch at
which each particular commodity came into vogue,
or was abandoned for something else.</p>

<p class='c001'>Attica itself exported comparatively few of its
own natural productions;<a id='r1751' /><a href='#f1751' class='c014'><sup>[1751]</sup></a> but having obtained the
raw materials from other regions, it expended upon
them so much skill, and taste, and industry, that they
appeared to undergo a new creation, and were issued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>from the Peiræeus like the native growth of the
soil. This was the case with various kinds of arms
and armour, as sabres, and scimitars, greaves, cuirasses,
and helmets.<a id='r1752' /><a href='#f1752' class='c014'><sup>[1752]</sup></a> These were sometimes richly
gilt or inlaid with gold, and adorned with embossed
figures of rare workmanship.<a id='r1753' /><a href='#f1753' class='c014'><sup>[1753]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Perfumes,<a id='r1754' /><a href='#f1754' class='c014'><sup>[1754]</sup></a> also, with unguents and essences,<a id='r1755' /><a href='#f1755' class='c014'><sup>[1755]</sup></a> and
odoriferous oils were among the exports of Athens,
which, indeed, at one period retailed to the rest
of Greece the manufactures of every country in
the civilised world.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the articles of merchandise,<a id='r1756' /><a href='#f1756' class='c014'><sup>[1756]</sup></a> the peculiar
produce of her own soil, were the fragrant gold-coloured
honey of Hymettos, the best in the ancient
world; olives, and olive oil,<a id='r1757' /><a href='#f1757' class='c014'><sup>[1757]</sup></a> which likewise
appear to have been unrivalled; fruits of various
kinds, but more especially figs,<a id='r1758' /><a href='#f1758' class='c014'><sup>[1758]</sup></a> which were transported
to Persia and most of the other regions of
the East.<a id='r1759' /><a href='#f1759' class='c014'><sup>[1759]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>A trade was carried on too in herbs and plants,
which being more fragrant and possessing greater
virtues here than in any other country, the citizens
of the neighbouring states sought to obtain the like,
by procuring slips and seeds from Athens. Thus
strangers having observed that the knolls and uplands
of Attica were covered with thyme,<a id='r1760' /><a href='#f1760' class='c014'><sup>[1760]</sup></a> which,
flowering about midsummer, filled the air with
sweetness, and enabled the owners of bees to foretell
with exactness whether honey would be scarce
or plentiful, desired to transplant it to the neighbourhood
of their own cities. It was found however
by experience, that it flourished and attained
its natural luxuriance only in such situations as
were reached by the sea breezes.<a id='r1761' /><a href='#f1761' class='c014'><sup>[1761]</sup></a> In Arcadia, for
example, it refused to be naturalised, though the
climate of that country was found to agree very
well with the marjoram, and the summer savory.
Among the simples employed by the ancients in
their materia medica were the Attic valerian,<a id='r1762' /><a href='#f1762' class='c014'><sup>[1762]</sup></a> hemlock,<a id='r1763' /><a href='#f1763' class='c014'><sup>[1763]</sup></a>
and melilot.<a id='r1764' /><a href='#f1764' class='c014'><sup>[1764]</sup></a> Kermes also were produced in
this country.<a id='r1765' /><a href='#f1765' class='c014'><sup>[1765]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Athenian pottery,<a id='r1766' /><a href='#f1766' class='c014'><sup>[1766]</sup></a> being the most tasteful and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>beautiful known to the ancient world, was consequently
in great request and exported in immense
quantities to all the countries on the shores of the
Mediterranean.<a id='r1767' /><a href='#f1767' class='c014'><sup>[1767]</sup></a> At one time, however, the people of
Ægina and Argos, partly out of resentment,<a id='r1768' /><a href='#f1768' class='c014'><sup>[1768]</sup></a> and partly
to encourage some less costly manufacture of their
own, prohibited its introduction; while the people
of Aulis,<a id='r1769' /><a href='#f1769' class='c014'><sup>[1769]</sup></a> Samos,<a id='r1770' /><a href='#f1770' class='c014'><sup>[1770]</sup></a> and Rhodes,<a id='r1771' /><a href='#f1771' class='c014'><sup>[1771]</sup></a> became, in this
branch of industry, the rivals of the Athenians,
whom they endeavoured to undersell by producing
an inferior article.<a id='r1772' /><a href='#f1772' class='c014'><sup>[1772]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the other exports of Athens we find enumerated
soft fine wool,<a id='r1773' /><a href='#f1773' class='c014'><sup>[1773]</sup></a> linen and woollen cloths,<a id='r1774' /><a href='#f1774' class='c014'><sup>[1774]</sup></a>
slippers,<a id='r1775' /><a href='#f1775' class='c014'><sup>[1775]</sup></a> beds, chests, books,<a id='r1776' /><a href='#f1776' class='c014'><sup>[1776]</sup></a> wine,<a id='r1777' /><a href='#f1777' class='c014'><sup>[1777]</sup></a> Sphettian vinegar,<a id='r1778' /><a href='#f1778' class='c014'><sup>[1778]</sup></a>
sweetmeats,<a id='r1779' /><a href='#f1779' class='c014'><sup>[1779]</sup></a> glaucisci,<a id='r1780' /><a href='#f1780' class='c014'><sup>[1780]</sup></a> anchovies,<a id='r1781' /><a href='#f1781' class='c014'><sup>[1781]</sup></a> sheep,<a id='r1782' /><a href='#f1782' class='c014'><sup>[1782]</sup></a> live
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>fowls,<a id='r1783' /><a href='#f1783' class='c014'><sup>[1783]</sup></a> Hymettian<a id='r1784' /><a href='#f1784' class='c014'><sup>[1784]</sup></a> and Pentelic<a id='r1785' /><a href='#f1785' class='c014'><sup>[1785]</sup></a> marbles, quicksilver,<a id='r1786' /><a href='#f1786' class='c014'><sup>[1786]</sup></a>
ochre,<a id='r1787' /><a href='#f1787' class='c014'><sup>[1787]</sup></a> and cinnabar.<a id='r1788' /><a href='#f1788' class='c014'><sup>[1788]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another class of exports consisted of statues and
works of arts of all kinds, in gold, marble, bronze,
and ivory, jewellery, and engraved gems.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the most valuable and commodious of all her
merchandise was that silver<a id='r1789' /><a href='#f1789' class='c014'><sup>[1789]</sup></a> of unrivalled purity and
fineness which so long placed her foremost among
the commercial states of antiquity, and was one of
the great props of her empire both by sea and land.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the matter of imports we shall consider Athens
in a double point of view; first as the purchaser of
the surplus produce of the other Grecian states,<a id='r1790' /><a href='#f1790' class='c014'><sup>[1790]</sup></a>
and second as the representative of Greece in general,
collecting together in her ports the commodities
of the rest of the world, and afterwards distributing
them among her neighbours. With the Megaris,
which once formed part of her own territory, Athens,
at particular periods of her history, carried on an
active traffic in the common necessaries of life,—as
groats,<a id='r1791' /><a href='#f1791' class='c014'><sup>[1791]</sup></a> fish,<a id='r1792' /><a href='#f1792' class='c014'><sup>[1792]</sup></a> salt,<a id='r1793' /><a href='#f1793' class='c014'><sup>[1793]</sup></a> goats, vegetables,<a id='r1794' /><a href='#f1794' class='c014'><sup>[1794]</sup></a> leverets, poultry,
pigs, and cattle.<a id='r1795' /><a href='#f1795' class='c014'><sup>[1795]</sup></a> Hemlock was likewise numbered
among the exports of Megara,<a id='r1796' /><a href='#f1796' class='c014'><sup>[1796]</sup></a> together with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>jars,<a id='r1797' /><a href='#f1797' class='c014'><sup>[1797]</sup></a> and rough upper garments.<a id='r1798' /><a href='#f1798' class='c014'><sup>[1798]</sup></a> It seems probable
moreover that, as numerous sheep were reared in
this territory, fine wool was likewise on occasions
imported thence into Attica,<a id='r1799' /><a href='#f1799' class='c014'><sup>[1799]</sup></a> together with the rich
sweet wine made at Ægosthena.<a id='r1800' /><a href='#f1800' class='c014'><sup>[1800]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From the various divisions of the Peloponnesos,
which we may here regard as one country, several
useful commodities were exported. In the matter
of corn these divisions of Greece were alternately
exporters and importers according, probably, to the
fluctuations of the season or peculiar exigencies created
by the accidents of peace or war.<a id='r1801' /><a href='#f1801' class='c014'><sup>[1801]</sup></a> They perpetually,
however, supplied their neighbours with
cheese and wine, and various other articles of use
or luxury.</p>

<p class='c001'>The poet Alcman celebrates a fragrant wine produced
in the vicinity of Sparta,<a id='r1802' /><a href='#f1802' class='c014'><sup>[1802]</sup></a> but it is nowhere
stated whether it was exported or not. The little state
of Phlius produced likewise a superior wine which
was esteemed at Athens.<a id='r1803' /><a href='#f1803' class='c014'><sup>[1803]</sup></a> Laconia exported cheese,
which, being shipped at Gythium,<a id='r1804' /><a href='#f1804' class='c014'><sup>[1804]</sup></a> was commonly
supposed to be made at that place. The cheese of
Tromileia in Achaia enjoyed as great a reputation
throughout Greece, as the Parmasan in modern
Europe. It was remarkable for the extreme delicacy
of its flavour, and was made from goat’s milk
with the juice of the fig-tree instead of rennet.<a id='r1805' /><a href='#f1805' class='c014'><sup>[1805]</sup></a>
Sicyon carried on a considerable trade in salted
conger.<a id='r1806' /><a href='#f1806' class='c014'><sup>[1806]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Several medicinal plants were obtained from this
part of Greece, as liquorice vetch<a id='r1807' /><a href='#f1807' class='c014'><sup>[1807]</sup></a> found on the tops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>of lofty mountains where the snows lay unmelted
during a considerable portion of the year. The canton
which most abounded in this plant seems to
have been the country round Pheneon in Arcadia.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the neighbourhood of Psophis in the same
state, the cultivation of the heraclean all-heal<a id='r1808' /><a href='#f1808' class='c014'><sup>[1808]</sup></a> was
carried on to a great extent, as Arcadia traded
largely in this article of the materia medica. The
juice was collected in two ways, and at two different
seasons of the year; first from the root when
the plant began to germinate in spring. A small
trench having been excavated about it, an incision
was made in the root and a number of broad leaves
spread around to receive the liquor which flowed
forth. This, at first white, assumed externally as
it dried, a saffron hue. The second method was
to make an incision in the stem about harvest-time,
when the fluid appears tog have been collected
in the same manner as before. Near Nonacris was
obtained a poisonous water which distilled slowly
like dew from a rock. It was of a sharp and icy
coldness, and so bitter and acrid, that no vessel
whatsoever could contain it save the hoof of an ass,
in which accordingly it was preserved.<a id='r1809' /><a href='#f1809' class='c014'><sup>[1809]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the poisons of the Peloponnesos was the
root of the meadow-saffron,<a id='r1810' /><a href='#f1810' class='c014'><sup>[1810]</sup></a> found chiefly in Messenia,
where likewise grew the æthiopis, a plant
used by magicians as well as by the children of
Æsculapius.<a id='r1811' /><a href='#f1811' class='c014'><sup>[1811]</sup></a> The centaury,<a id='r1812' /><a href='#f1812' class='c014'><sup>[1812]</sup></a> likewise, and the seseli,<a id='r1813' /><a href='#f1813' class='c014'><sup>[1813]</sup></a>
were among the exports of this part of Greece.</p>

<p class='c001'>From Arcadia were obtained large carbuncles,<a id='r1814' /><a href='#f1814' class='c014'><sup>[1814]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>which were cut and polished into mirrors, with
timber of all kinds,—as deal, larch, and pine, together
with the smilax,<a id='r1815' /><a href='#f1815' class='c014'><sup>[1815]</sup></a> which was sawed into thin
planks, and used for necessary articles of furniture.
The neighbourhood of Mantinea produced an excellent
species of radish which was exported.<a id='r1816' /><a href='#f1816' class='c014'><sup>[1816]</sup></a> Arcadia
likewise produced, in its rich pastures, fine herds
of cattle, together with asses and horses, no way
inferior to those of Thessaly.<a id='r1817' /><a href='#f1817' class='c014'><sup>[1817]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Argos exported also horses,<a id='r1818' /><a href='#f1818' class='c014'><sup>[1818]</sup></a> with purple garments,<a id='r1819' /><a href='#f1819' class='c014'><sup>[1819]</sup></a>

in this part of the isthmus; and probably pears
which were found every where else in Peloponnesos.
Corinthia abounded also with large and excellent
turnips, which were no doubt exported to
the neighbouring countries.<a id='r1844' /><a href='#f1844' class='c014'><sup>[1844]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the productions which Laconia<a id='r1845' /><a href='#f1845' class='c014'><sup>[1845]</sup></a> supplied

<p class='c016'>In addition to the above, Sparta exported cothons,<a id='r1854' /><a href='#f1854' class='c014'><sup>[1854]</sup></a>
a species of fictile cups of a dusky brown,
and so small as to have been conveniently carried
in the long-necked wicker baskets which served
the soldiers of Greece in lieu of a knapsack. It
had one handle, and the rim projecting inwards,
kept back the grosser particles of mud contained
in the water, or rather, perhaps, deceived the eye
by its hue. It was, moreover, the common drinking
vessel of sailors on board ship.<a id='r1855' /><a href='#f1855' class='c014'><sup>[1855]</sup></a> The manufacture
of these cups formed a distinct branch of
business, the individuals engaged in which were
called cothon-makers,<a id='r1856' /><a href='#f1856' class='c014'><sup>[1856]</sup></a> to distinguish them from ordinary
potters.</p>

<p class='c001'>In their festivals and marriage entertainments, as
well as in war which they regarded much in the
same light, the Spartans indulged in the luxury of
fictile vessels, but at their common tables they
drank out of wooden bowls,<a id='r1857' /><a href='#f1857' class='c014'><sup>[1857]</sup></a> for the production of
which, as well as of smaller goblets, Laconia was
famous. It likewise, in later times at least, manufactured
for exportation massive gold plate curiously
chased, which, under the Macedonian kings,
found its way to Egypt.<a id='r1858' /><a href='#f1858' class='c014'><sup>[1858]</sup></a> Indeed these military
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>utilitarians appear to have excelled in the making
of all articles of ordinary convenience, as couches,
easy-chairs, and tables, which accordingly were much
sought after.<a id='r1859' /><a href='#f1859' class='c014'><sup>[1859]</sup></a> Doors have likewise been enumerated
among Laconian exports,<a id='r1860' /><a href='#f1860' class='c014'><sup>[1860]</sup></a> but with little
probability, especially when we recollect the directions
given by the Spartan legislator for the construction
of this part of domestic defence;<a id='r1861' /><a href='#f1861' class='c014'><sup>[1861]</sup></a> nor is
it a jot more likely that the carts and waggons
which the Lacedæmonians constructed of smilax ever
found their way beyond the borders of Laconia,
unless employed in carrying provisions for its own
armies.<a id='r1862' /><a href='#f1862' class='c014'><sup>[1862]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The steel and iron, however, of the Lacedæmonian
forges were, as elsewhere stated, in great request for
the making of carpenters’ and stonecutters’ tools, augers,
files, chisels,<a id='r1863' /><a href='#f1863' class='c014'><sup>[1863]</sup></a> &amp;c.; as were likewise the Laconian
locks and keys, which were divided into three wards,
and far more intricate than those in common use.<a id='r1864' /><a href='#f1864' class='c014'><sup>[1864]</sup></a>
The manufactures which flourished in the city of
Sparta itself, and were chiefly, perhaps, designed to
supply the home-market were those of iron rings,
daggers,<a id='r1865' /><a href='#f1865' class='c014'><sup>[1865]</sup></a> short scimitars, swords, spits, axes, hatchets,
and scythes, together with felt,<a id='r1866' /><a href='#f1866' class='c014'><sup>[1866]</sup></a> walking-sticks,<a id='r1867' /><a href='#f1867' class='c014'><sup>[1867]</sup></a> lute
and bow-strings, which, as well as several of the
above, we know to have been exported.<a id='r1868' /><a href='#f1868' class='c014'><sup>[1868]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>The citizens of Amyclæ excelled in the making
of ladies’ slippers;<a id='r1869' /><a href='#f1869' class='c014'><sup>[1869]</sup></a> and in the other parts of Laconia
were produced an elegant kind of men’s shoes of
red leather,<a id='r1870' /><a href='#f1870' class='c014'><sup>[1870]</sup></a> like those at present worn by the
Turks.<a id='r1871' /><a href='#f1871' class='c014'><sup>[1871]</sup></a> In weaving and dyeing, also, the Lacedæmonians
distinguished themselves, their mantles<a id='r1872' /><a href='#f1872' class='c014'><sup>[1872]</sup></a> and
their woollen garments, whether of purple or scarlet,<a id='r1873' /><a href='#f1873' class='c014'><sup>[1873]</sup></a>
having been in much esteem throughout Greece,
as was likewise the purple by itself.<a id='r1874' /><a href='#f1874' class='c014'><sup>[1874]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If we proceed now to the states of northern
Greece, commencing with Bœotia, we shall find, that
their exports were little less rich or varied. For
the daily consumption of life<a id='r1875' /><a href='#f1875' class='c014'><sup>[1875]</sup></a> the Athenians obtained
from this country a plentiful supply of poultry
and wild-fowl,<a id='r1876' /><a href='#f1876' class='c014'><sup>[1876]</sup></a> such as the francolin, the coot,
ducks, divers, geese,<a id='r1877' /><a href='#f1877' class='c014'><sup>[1877]</sup></a> jackdaws, and pyctides. Cats,
too, were among the exports of Bœotia, (though
whether, as in Spain, they were substituted for rabbits
at table, seems hard to determine,) together
with foxes, moles, otters, hares, and hedgehogs.<a id='r1878' /><a href='#f1878' class='c014'><sup>[1878]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This state, likewise, furnished the rest of Greece
with reeds<a id='r1879' /><a href='#f1879' class='c014'><sup>[1879]</sup></a> for the manufacture of pipes and flutes:
they were produced on the banks of the Melas, a
river which, according to the ancients, resembled in
character and productions the Egyptian Nile. The
wheat of Bœotia, where such is the fertility of the
soil, that it returns fifty for one, was of old observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>to be so heavy and full of nourishment, that the
athletæ<a id='r1880' /><a href='#f1880' class='c014'><sup>[1880]</sup></a> considered a chœnix and a half of it as
equal to two chœnices of that produced in Attica.
If any country, therefore, could, in the matter of
bread, have been expected to be independent of its
neighbours, it would doubtless have been Bœotia,
which, nevertheless, we find importing, in times of
scarcity, corn from Thessaly.<a id='r1881' /><a href='#f1881' class='c014'><sup>[1881]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The remaining exports of this state may be thus

<p class='c001'>The productions which Macedonia and Thrace

value; as, for example, gold and silver,<a id='r1932' /><a href='#f1932' class='c014'><sup>[1932]</sup></a> of which

<p class='c001'>Melilot<a id='r1991' /><a href='#f1991' class='c014'><sup>[1991]</sup></a> was exported from Chalcedon, and Cyzicos,

appears to have grown abundantly amid the neighbouring
hills, and was commonly wreathed in garlands.
The making of this article of commerce was
a complicated operation, and numerous ingredients
entered into its composition,—as oil of green olives,
and of acorns, balsam wood, odoriferous rushes and
reeds perfumed with marjoram, spikenard, costus,
amomon, cassia, carpobalsamon, and myrrh. To render
the ointment still more precious cinnamon was
sometimes intermingled with it, the vessel in which
it was kept moistened with wine, while honey was
made the basis of the paste.</p>

<p class='c001'>The shores of the Propontis furnished wine flavoured

to have been that indurated froth of the sea,<a id='r1995' /><a href='#f1995' class='c014'><sup>[1995]</sup></a> with
which the halcyon built her nest. It was obtained
as well on the continent as from the island of Besbicos,
now Kalolimno.<a id='r1996' /><a href='#f1996' class='c014'><sup>[1996]</sup></a> A very similar substance,
called Adarces, was found in Cappadocia,<a id='r1997' /><a href='#f1997' class='c014'><sup>[1997]</sup></a> about the
rivers and marshes, where it hung suspended on the
tops of reeds. Aconite<a id='r1998' /><a href='#f1998' class='c014'><sup>[1998]</sup></a> and origany came from the
country of the Maryandinians,<a id='r1999' /><a href='#f1999' class='c014'><sup>[1999]</sup></a> and agaric from Sarmatia,<a id='r2000' /><a href='#f2000' class='c014'><sup>[2000]</sup></a>

of Marmora produced black coral, as also a sort of
floating petroleum.<a id='r2001' /><a href='#f2001' class='c014'><sup>[2001]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>The orpiment<a id='r2002' /><a href='#f2002' class='c014'><sup>[2002]</sup></a> of Pontos and Cappadocia enjoyed
but a secondary reputation; the first place being
given to that of Mysia. The lapis lazuli<a id='r2003' /><a href='#f2003' class='c014'><sup>[2003]</sup></a> of Scythia
necessarily found its way into Greece by the
Black Sea, as did, likewise, the cinnabar of Colchis,
said to have been discovered amid inaccessible
rocks and precipices,<a id='r2004' /><a href='#f2004' class='c014'><sup>[2004]</sup></a> whence it was brought down
by darts and arrows. Probably, also, brass was exported
from Colchis.<a id='r2005' /><a href='#f2005' class='c014'><sup>[2005]</sup></a> In the Homeric age great
quantities of silver<a id='r2006' /><a href='#f2006' class='c014'><sup>[2006]</sup></a> would seem to have been obtained
from the country of the Halizones, as in
later ages of steel and iron from that part of Asia
Minor inhabited by the Chalybes,<a id='r2007' /><a href='#f2007' class='c014'><sup>[2007]</sup></a> who are said to
have worked their mines naked. The finest kind
of minium was excavated from certain caverns in
Cappadocia,<a id='r2008' /><a href='#f2008' class='c014'><sup>[2008]</sup></a> and transported by land to the city
of Sinope, whence it was sent into Greece.<a id='r2009' /><a href='#f2009' class='c014'><sup>[2009]</sup></a> It
was of three kinds,—the one deep, the other extremely
pale, and the third sort a shade between
the two. There were likewise in the same district
mines of ochre, and both were so infected with
damp and malaria, that the workmen, as in our
own coalpits, were constantly in danger of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>lives.<a id='r2010' /><a href='#f2010' class='c014'><sup>[2010]</sup></a> Many of the commodities of this place
were probably distributed through Greece and Asia
by the travelling merchants, who resorted, at the
annual festival of the goddess, to the great fair of
Komana.<a id='r2011' /><a href='#f2011' class='c014'><sup>[2011]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In speaking of the Black Sea we have already
entered upon that of Asia Minor, which, taken altogether,
was perhaps the richest and most important
anywhere carried on by the Greeks. Every
province of this fertile and beautiful division of
Asia abounded in costly or useful articles of merchandise,
and its roads and rivers incessantly poured
towards Greece not only the productions of its own
soil, but those also of Central Asia, brought thither
by the caravans from both shores of the Caspian.
Gold dust<a id='r2012' /><a href='#f2012' class='c014'><sup>[2012]</sup></a> was collected from the sands of the
Pactolos;<a id='r2013' /><a href='#f2013' class='c014'><sup>[2013]</sup></a> marbles of the most brilliant whiteness
were exported from Ephesos, (whose inhabitants decreed
divine honours to the shepherd Pyxodoros,<a id='r2014' /><a href='#f2014' class='c014'><sup>[2014]</sup></a>

Synnada in Phrygia;<a id='r2015' /><a href='#f2015' class='c014'><sup>[2015]</sup></a> large veins of lapis specularis,
a stone so transparent<a id='r2016' /><a href='#f2016' class='c014'><sup>[2016]</sup></a> that it served the ancients
instead of glass for windows, were found in Cappadocia;
the precious gem called alabandine<a id='r2017' /><a href='#f2017' class='c014'><sup>[2017]</sup></a> was
procured from the district round Miletos, jet<a id='r2018' /><a href='#f2018' class='c014'><sup>[2018]</sup></a> from
Lycia, not far from the river Gagas, and the fortress
Plagiopolis. The places whence this mineral
is chiefly obtained at present are Inspruck, in the
Tyrol,<a id='r2019' /><a href='#f2019' class='c014'><sup>[2019]</sup></a> where it is rolled down by the waters of
a certain stream, and Wirtemberg,<a id='r2020' /><a href='#f2020' class='c014'><sup>[2020]</sup></a> where it is
wrought into all kinds of ornaments.</p>

<p class='c001'>The touchstone was found in great quantities in
the bed of the river Tmolos.<a id='r2021' /><a href='#f2021' class='c014'><sup>[2021]</sup></a> It resembled in form
a flat pebble, though considerably larger, and the
side which had lain uppermost exposed to the sun
was supposed to exercise a greater power over metals
than the side opposite, which was more saturated
with moisture. Basalt and the green marble
called verdello are now often used instead of it in
making experiments on the purity of gold.<a id='r2022' /><a href='#f2022' class='c014'><sup>[2022]</sup></a> From
this part of the world also was first obtained that
extraordinary stone whose properties slightly observed
by the ancients have since effected so wonderful
a change in the science of navigation; I

the city of Heraclea.<a id='r2023' /><a href='#f2023' class='c014'><sup>[2023]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the neighbourhood of Ephesos there was a manufacture
of cinnabar,<a id='r2024' /><a href='#f2024' class='c014'><sup>[2024]</sup></a> which was produced in the
following manner: taking a quantity of sand of a
bright scarlet colour, they triturated it to a very fine
powder in stone mortars, after which it was washed
in brazen vessels, and the remainder pounded and
washed as before till the whole had been reduced
to the fineness required.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fossil and mineral salt called alum,<a id='r2025' /><a href='#f2025' class='c014'><sup>[2025]</sup></a> was dug
out of the earth near Hierapolis in Phrygia, from
which country also the best salt<a id='r2026' /><a href='#f2026' class='c014'><sup>[2026]</sup></a> was procured. It
was found, as at present, on the shores of Lake Tatta,
on which account it obtained the name of the Tattæan
salt.<a id='r2027' /><a href='#f2027' class='c014'><sup>[2027]</sup></a> A causeway traverses the lake nearly
through the centre, as in the case of the lake Tritonis
in northern Africa.</p>

<p class='c001'>The best nitre<a id='r2028' /><a href='#f2028' class='c014'><sup>[2028]</sup></a> known to the ancients came from
Philadelphia, near the source of the Cogamos in
Lydia. That of Magnesia, in Caria, was esteemed
inferior. From Colophon,<a id='r2029' /><a href='#f2029' class='c014'><sup>[2029]</sup></a> in early times was obtained
that liquid resin which distils from the pine
and pitch trees, on which account it obtained the
name of Colophonia.<a id='r2030' /><a href='#f2030' class='c014'><sup>[2030]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Medicinal chalk<a id='r2031' /><a href='#f2031' class='c014'><sup>[2031]</sup></a> and dry pitch, of which there
were two kinds,<a id='r2032' /><a href='#f2032' class='c014'><sup>[2032]</sup></a> were imported from Lycia and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Mysia.<a id='r2033' /><a href='#f2033' class='c014'><sup>[2033]</sup></a> From the same country likewise, as well
as from Galatia, came the best wild cumin,<a id='r2034' /><a href='#f2034' class='c014'><sup>[2034]</sup></a> a low
plant found growing along the slopes and crests
of hills. Herb mastic,<a id='r2035' /><a href='#f2035' class='c014'><sup>[2035]</sup></a> resembling origany in fragrance,
was produced in Magnesia and around the
Lydian city of Tralles. Both Lydia and Cilicia
exported saffron.<a id='r2036' /><a href='#f2036' class='c014'><sup>[2036]</sup></a> That, however, which enjoyed
among the ancients the greatest celebrity grew upon
the heights of Mount Corycos,<a id='r2037' /><a href='#f2037' class='c014'><sup>[2037]</sup></a> in the neighbourhood
of the Corycian cave.<a id='r2038' /><a href='#f2038' class='c014'><sup>[2038]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The saffron of Lycia was likewise the produce of
a mountain, being found chiefly on the Olympos of
that country.<a id='r2039' /><a href='#f2039' class='c014'><sup>[2039]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The kermes,<a id='r2040' /><a href='#f2040' class='c014'><sup>[2040]</sup></a> with which alone before the discovery
of America and the introduction of cochineal,
a bright scarlet dye could be produced, were obtained
from various parts of Asia Minor, Galatia,
Lycia, and Cilicia, where they were found feeding
on the leaves of the scarlet oak.<a id='r2041' /><a href='#f2041' class='c014'><sup>[2041]</sup></a> The gathering
of these insects, then, however, supposed to be mere
tubercular excrescences, formed an important branch
of industry, carried on entirely by women, who separated
them from the leaf with a crooked iron instrument,
and not with the mouth as has been
inferred from a wrong reading in Dioscorides.<a id='r2042' /><a href='#f2042' class='c014'><sup>[2042]</sup></a>
At present the nail only is used in this operation,
which is performed before sunrise, while the dew

last plant the rizotomists observed certain rules.
Going forth at peep of dawn into the fields, they
were careful to cull it immediately before the rising

virtues of plants are in great perfection.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this country as well as from Cappadocia
was obtained the lycion,<a id='r2051' /><a href='#f2051' class='c014'><sup>[2051]</sup></a> a syrup about the consistence

Potters, notwithstanding the utility
of their calling, appear to
have been assailed by many a
joke among the Athenians, who
sometimes sarcastically denominated
them Prometheuses. Καὶ

Hippolochos to Lynceus: καὶ

a honey of a bitter taste,
(Dion. Chrysost. i. 289, seq.)
collected, according to Dioscorides
(ii. 103), and Pliny (Nat. Hist.
xxi. 44), from the purple flowered
dwarf rhododendron which abounds
on the northern shores of
the Black Sea, more particularly
in the vicinity of Trebizond.
(Tournefort, t. iii. p. 74, sqq.)
This, apparently, was the honey
that produced effects so extraordinary
upon the Ten Thousand,
(Xenoph. Anab. iv. 8. 20,) and
had the reputation of causing
temporary madness. The shrub
above named must be carefully
distinguished from the common
rhododendron which yields no
honey. Della Rocca, i. 352, seq.
Another cause of the bitterness of
the Colchian honey is assigned
by Lamberti: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Ils mettent quelquefois
leur miel dans des écorces
de citrouilles amères, ce
qui a peut-être donné sujet à
Strabon, [l. xi. c. 2. t. ii. p.

  <h3 id='ch6.12' class='c012'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> EXPORTS OF THE ISLANDS, ITALY, GAUL, AND SPAIN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Before we describe the trade of Syria, Egypt,
and the farther East, we shall endeavour to give
some account of that carried on by the numerous
islands of the Mediterranean, together with Italy,
Gaul, and Spain, and the whole northern coast of
Africa. The commodities furnished to commerce by
the various groups and larger islands of the Ægæan
and Ionian seas scarcely yielded in number to those
of Asia Minor. Of these the most important were
the wines, which fluctuated in value, strength, and
flavour, according to the soil, temperature, and elevation
above the sea, of the vineyards which produced
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The island of Lesbos, during the flourishing ages
of the Athenian republic, formed part, as it were,
of the territory of that great maritime state which
compelled it to carry its wines exclusively to Athens.<a id='r2110' /><a href='#f2110' class='c014'><sup>[2110]</sup></a>
Among these was the Pramnian,<a id='r2111' /><a href='#f2111' class='c014'><sup>[2111]</sup></a> which, also produced
in Achaia, was a strong, harsh wine, apparently
resembling port. Most, however, of the
islands,<a id='r2112' /><a href='#f2112' class='c014'><sup>[2112]</sup></a> both large and small, supplied wine—as Tenedos,<a id='r2113' /><a href='#f2113' class='c014'><sup>[2113]</sup></a>
Chios,<a id='r2114' /><a href='#f2114' class='c014'><sup>[2114]</sup></a> Cypros,<a id='r2115' /><a href='#f2115' class='c014'><sup>[2115]</sup></a> which furnished, among
others, a curious fig wine;<a id='r2116' /><a href='#f2116' class='c014'><sup>[2116]</sup></a> Thasos,<a id='r2117' /><a href='#f2117' class='c014'><sup>[2117]</sup></a> where one particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>kind was somniferous,<a id='r2118' /><a href='#f2118' class='c014'><sup>[2118]</sup></a> Peparethos, Lesbos,
Eubœa,<a id='r2119' /><a href='#f2119' class='c014'><sup>[2119]</sup></a> Crete, where among others was found the
Malmsey;<a id='r2120' /><a href='#f2120' class='c014'><sup>[2120]</sup></a> Leucadia, Cos,<a id='r2121' /><a href='#f2121' class='c014'><sup>[2121]</sup></a> and Corcyra.</p>

<p class='c001'>Few of the islands grew more corn than they could
consume, except Eubœa,<a id='r2122' /><a href='#f2122' class='c014'><sup>[2122]</sup></a> which was for many years
the granary of Athens. Lesbos,<a id='r2123' /><a href='#f2123' class='c014'><sup>[2123]</sup></a> too, produced
the most superb barley, which was grown upon the
hills round Eresos, the birthplace of Theophrastus.
The Thasians, likewise, cultivated an inferior kind
of barley which, from the extreme productiveness
of the island, seems occasionally to have been exported,
though I remember no authority in proof
of the fact. Samos furnished Greece with the best
olive oil next to that of Attica.<a id='r2124' /><a href='#f2124' class='c014'><sup>[2124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But of all the minor islands none appear to have
supplied so many articles to the coasting trade of
Greece as Thasos, whose productions were singularly
rich and varied. There, in the earlier ages, the
Phœnicians discovered and worked gold mines which
in after times became exhausted, but the fertility
of the island and the industry of its inhabitants
seem never to have failed. From hence were exported
radishes,<a id='r2125' /><a href='#f2125' class='c014'><sup>[2125]</sup></a> fish sauce, pickles,<a id='r2126' /><a href='#f2126' class='c014'><sup>[2126]</sup></a> almonds, and
walnuts,<a id='r2127' /><a href='#f2127' class='c014'><sup>[2127]</sup></a> with the trees of which the island was
thickly shaded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Crete, Cypros, and Naxos exported hones;<a id='r2128' /><a href='#f2128' class='c014'><sup>[2128]</sup></a> Paros
figs<a id='r2129' /><a href='#f2129' class='c014'><sup>[2129]</sup></a> and the best white marble<a id='r2130' /><a href='#f2130' class='c014'><sup>[2130]</sup></a> drawn from quarries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>the vast extent of which is still the admiration
of travellers.<a id='r2131' /><a href='#f2131' class='c014'><sup>[2131]</sup></a> Cypros, sory, a substance resembling
verdigris,<a id='r2132' /><a href='#f2132' class='c014'><sup>[2132]</sup></a> sulphate of copper, emeralds, and jasper.<a id='r2133' /><a href='#f2133' class='c014'><sup>[2133]</sup></a>
Linen, white and dyed purple, was brought
from Amorgos;<a id='r2134' /><a href='#f2134' class='c014'><sup>[2134]</sup></a> thapsia from Thapsos;<a id='r2135' /><a href='#f2135' class='c014'><sup>[2135]</sup></a> painters’
earth of the best quality, that is of loose texture,
crumbling, dry, and without fatness,<a id='r2136' /><a href='#f2136' class='c014'><sup>[2136]</sup></a> obtained
from the neighbourhood of Pharis; sulphur,<a id='r2137' /><a href='#f2137' class='c014'><sup>[2137]</sup></a> alum,<a id='r2138' /><a href='#f2138' class='c014'><sup>[2138]</sup></a>
and pumice stone from Nisyros and Melos,<a id='r2139' /><a href='#f2139' class='c014'><sup>[2139]</sup></a>
where this latter substance was extremely light,
and sometimes found imbedded in other stones.
The pumices of the island of Nisyros<a id='r2140' /><a href='#f2140' class='c014'><sup>[2140]</sup></a> were of an
inferior description, and crumbled to pieces in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>hand. They were, however, extremely plentiful,
occurring in heaps, and generally about the size
of the fist.</p>

<p class='c001'>Carystos in Eubœa exported verde antico,<a id='r2141' /><a href='#f2141' class='c014'><sup>[2141]</sup></a> and
the amianthos, or stone from which towels and similar
fabrics were manufactured, indestructible by
fire;<a id='r2142' /><a href='#f2142' class='c014'><sup>[2142]</sup></a> Eretria medicinal earth;<a id='r2143' /><a href='#f2143' class='c014'><sup>[2143]</sup></a> Chalcis exported

jars<a id='r2146' /><a href='#f2146' class='c014'><sup>[2146]</sup></a> and medicinal earths, ash-coloured and white,<a id='r2147' /><a href='#f2147' class='c014'><sup>[2147]</sup></a>
in which was found a stone used by jewellers in
polishing gold.<a id='r2148' /><a href='#f2148' class='c014'><sup>[2148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From Lemnos three different kinds of earth were
obtained,—the first known among the ancients by
the name of terra sigillata, was sold in small round
cakes mingled, according to Dioscorides,<a id='r2149' /><a href='#f2149' class='c014'><sup>[2149]</sup></a> with the
blood of a goat and stamped with his image in
the sacred seal of Artemis; though Galen, who
visited the island on purpose to examine this earth,
denies that, in his time, any blood was intermixed
with it. The second of the Lemnian earths<a id='r2150' /><a href='#f2150' class='c014'><sup>[2150]</sup></a> was
reddle, and the third fullers’ earth. The first of
these earths, of a slight red colour, was sometimes
denominated sacred, apparently because used in sacrifices.
In modern times the substance known
under this name is usually brown or pink-coloured.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>The mine<a id='r2151' /><a href='#f2151' class='c014'><sup>[2151]</sup></a> whence the sealed earth is at present
excavated lies on the summit of a precipitous
mountain, on the eastern shore of the island, about
four bowshots from the ancient city of Hephæstia.
The road leading thither, after arriving at the chapel
of Sotira, is divided, and branches off to the
right and left. Both ways pass by a fountain;
the one on the right bordered with elder, willow,
and carob trees, by one which, though closely shaded
from the sun’s rays, fails in summer; while that on
the left conducts to a spring which, lying in a
marshy spot, producing nothing but rushes, is perennial.
Both these fountains are situated among
the roots of the hill, now ascended by steps cut
in the rock, but anciently by a road practicable
all the way to the summit. The digging of the
Lemnian earth appears to have been always under
the protection of religion; for, during the operation,
a priest anciently stood on the mountain near the
mine, and, after having made a sort of libation of
corn, which was cast as an offering upon the ground,
and performed various other ceremonies, caused a
waggon to be laden with the earth and conducted
to the city, where it was prepared, sealed, and sold
to merchants.</p>

<p class='c001'>In modern times, ever since the period when
the Venetians were in possession of the island,
a different and more cumbrous set of ceremonies
has been practised.<a id='r2152' /><a href='#f2152' class='c014'><sup>[2152]</sup></a> The principal inhabitants of
the island, both Turks and Christians, assembling
on the sixth of August, march out in grand procession
to the mountains of sealed earth, halting by
the way at the chapel of Sotira, where the priests
chant the liturgy of the Greek church, and repeat
many prayers, after which they ascend the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>acclivity. Arrived at the summit, fifty or sixty stout
men commence excavating in search of the stratum
of precious clay, which being found, the priests fill
therewith a number of skin sacks, which they deliver
to the custody of the Subashi.</p>

<p class='c001'>When a sufficient quantity has been procured
the mouth of the mine is closed, and never opened
again until that day twelvemonths. A certain quantity
is then despatched to the Sultan, who distributes
it in presents to princes and monarchs. The
remainder is sold as of old to the merchants. It is
quite possible that this substance might be discovered
in other parts of the island; but the Greeks
would set no value upon it unless obtained from
the spot in question, and excavated with the proper
ceremonies. For any private individual to attempt
digging it is a capital offence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Copper dross or tutty<a id='r2153' /><a href='#f2153' class='c014'><sup>[2153]</sup></a> was obtained from the
muddy bottom of a copper mine in Cypros.<a id='r2154' /><a href='#f2154' class='c014'><sup>[2154]</sup></a> Having
been exposed to dry in the sun, a quantity of brushwood
was cast around it and set on fire, by which
means it underwent a second calcination, and thence
obtained the name of diphryges, or twice-burned.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the same island was found the recrement of
brass called Cadmia<a id='r2155' /><a href='#f2155' class='c014'><sup>[2155]</sup></a> by the ancients. It was generated
in the following manner: the furnaces in
which they smelted copper were constructed of iron
arched above, and of very large dimensions. As
the metal underwent the action of the fire, the
lighter and mere aërial particles, detaching themselves
from the molten mass, ascended like sparks,
rolling upwards along the sides of the furnace and
settling on the roof.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, these particles forming into layers, one
above another, coalesced into a hard substance
which was called Cadmia.<a id='r2156' /><a href='#f2156' class='c014'><sup>[2156]</sup></a> Of this there were several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>kinds, one of which was produced by the
burning of Pyrites, obtained from precipices overhanging
the city of Soli. In these extraordinary
mountains were found veins of copper ore,<a id='r2157' /><a href='#f2157' class='c014'><sup>[2157]</sup></a> sulphate
of copper,<a id='r2158' /><a href='#f2158' class='c014'><sup>[2158]</sup></a> sory,<a id='r2159' /><a href='#f2159' class='c014'><sup>[2159]</sup></a> verdigris,<a id='r2160' /><a href='#f2160' class='c014'><sup>[2160]</sup></a> lapis lazuli,<a id='r2161' /><a href='#f2161' class='c014'><sup>[2161]</sup></a> chrysocolla,<a id='r2162' /><a href='#f2162' class='c014'><sup>[2162]</sup></a>
copperas, and tutty.<a id='r2163' /><a href='#f2163' class='c014'><sup>[2163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The recrement of silver was produced in a similar
manner during the smelting of the silver ore, but
it was in colour paler, and of an inferior quality.
In various parts of the island were found in abundance
black and white alum,<a id='r2164' /><a href='#f2164' class='c014'><sup>[2164]</sup></a> nitre, sulphur, rock
and sea salt,<a id='r2165' /><a href='#f2165' class='c014'><sup>[2165]</sup></a> the former near Citium, the latter
in the neighbourhood of Salamis. It likewise exported
burnt copper and copper flakes. Several
kinds of precious stones were moreover discovered
here, as the diamond,<a id='r2166' /><a href='#f2166' class='c014'><sup>[2166]</sup></a> the emerald, the agate,<a id='r2167' /><a href='#f2167' class='c014'><sup>[2167]</sup></a> found
also at Lesbos, the opal, the jasper, the sapphire,
the eagle stone,<a id='r2168' /><a href='#f2168' class='c014'><sup>[2168]</sup></a> the amethyst,<a id='r2169' /><a href='#f2169' class='c014'><sup>[2169]</sup></a> crystal, and talc,<a id='r2170' /><a href='#f2170' class='c014'><sup>[2170]</sup></a>
and hones from the environs of Arsinoë.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Egyptians alloyed their silver money with
a third part of gypsum, copper, and an equal portion
of sulphur. Mines of gold have been in modern
times worked in the islands near Nicosia.</p>

<p class='c001'>The finely tempered steel of Cypros,<a id='r2171' /><a href='#f2171' class='c014'><sup>[2171]</sup></a> known by
the name of adamant among the ancients, was used
in making the best cuirasses and deemed impenetrable.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this island were obtained the finest spodium
and flowers of zinc, which were produced in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>following manner: In a building, two stories high,
was constructed a furnace, open at top, and having
directly over it a small aperture, communicating
with the upper room. The bellows were worked
in an adjoining apartment, the snout passing through
a wall into the furnace, with which the workman
was enabled to communicate by a small door. The
fossil Cadmian-stone having been broken into small
pieces was cast into the fire through an aperture
from above, after which the flames having been
blown up to greater fierceness, the mineral converted
itself into a dense white vapour, and a cloud
of fiery sparks ascended through the mouth of the
furnace, the lighter particles attaching themselves
like white bubbles or flocks of wool to the walls
and vaulted roof of the building, while the heavier,
after cooling, fell back into the flames or were
scattered about the floor, where they indurated and
formed a sort of incrustation. This coarser and
weightier substance was usually found when scraped
off to contain hairs, splinters, and particles of earth,
and received the name of spodion, while that detached
from the walls or roof was either milk-white
or azure, and was what we now denominate flowers
of zinc.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another mode of manufacturing this article was
to cast the fossil Cadmia, reduced to powder, on
the surface of the liquid metal in bronze furnaces
which caused a similar evaporation. Spodion was
likewise procured from gold, silver, and lead, and
next after the above this last was considered the
best.</p>

<p class='c001'>Near the village of Amianthos was a celebrated
asbestos quarry whose produce, a greyish filamentous
stone, was carded like wool and spun and woven
into cloth<a id='r2172' /><a href='#f2172' class='c014'><sup>[2172]</sup></a> which when soiled was cast into the
fire instead of being washed, and came forth brilliant
and pure as from the loom, though at each burning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>it lost something of its weight. In cerecloths of
asbestos the bodies of kings and illustrious personages
were burned, in antiquity, to preserve their remains
from mingling with the ashes of the pyre.<a id='r2173' /><a href='#f2173' class='c014'><sup>[2173]</sup></a>
Matches likewise were made of this substance, more
particularly for those durable lamps which were
kindled by the Pagans in sepulchres,<a id='r2174' /><a href='#f2174' class='c014'><sup>[2174]</sup></a> and supposed
to burn on for ever. Other quarries of asbestos
were found in Cypros, chiefly at the foot of the precipices
bordering the road leading from Gerandium
to Soli.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was found in the island of Siphnos a fossil
substance, usually of a spherical form, which was
scooped out, and turned into various articles, such
as vases, plates, and even pots which would bear
the fire. When rubbed with oil and exposed to the
action of the air it became black and hard, and
resembled the finest pottery:<a id='r2175' /><a href='#f2175' class='c014'><sup>[2175]</sup></a> similar stones are in
modern times brought from the island of Minorca.<a id='r2176' /><a href='#f2176' class='c014'><sup>[2176]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Two kinds of medicinal earths, the one white,
the other ash-coloured, were obtained from Eretria,

used in cosmetics and at the baths.<a id='r2178' /><a href='#f2178' class='c014'><sup>[2178]</sup></a> From time

from the island of Zacynthos<a id='r2179' /><a href='#f2179' class='c014'><sup>[2179]</sup></a> tar impregnated with
a bituminous scent. It was found anciently in a
pool, about seventy feet in circumference, and of
very great depth, situated in a small valley on the
sea-shore nearly encircled by mountains. The tar
ascended from the bottom in bubbles as large as a
cannon-ball, through the clear water, and on reaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>the surface spread over the pond in a kind of film.
It was drawn forth with myrtle branches attached
to the end of a pole, and laid in pits to harden,
after which it was barrelled and exported. It now
sells for about two shillings per cask.</p>

whose flowers were used in remedies for ophthalmia.<a id='r2200' /><a href='#f2200' class='c014'><sup>[2200]</sup></a>
The inhabitants of Rhodes obtained from
the Egyptian, or Pharaoh’s fig-tree, a medicinal gum
esteemed a remedy against the bite of serpents.<a id='r2201' /><a href='#f2201' class='c014'><sup>[2201]</sup></a>
In early spring, before the appearance of the fruit,
they gently bruised the bark with a stone, upon
which, on all sides, there gushed forth a kind of
liquor which, collected with flocks of wool or with
sponge, was suffered to harden, formed into small
round cakes, and preserved in earthen vases.<a id='r2202' /><a href='#f2202' class='c014'><sup>[2202]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The modes of collecting the ladanum,<a id='r2203' /><a href='#f2203' class='c014'><sup>[2203]</sup></a> of which
the best sort appears to have been found in Cypros,<a id='r2204' /><a href='#f2204' class='c014'><sup>[2204]</sup></a>
was still more curious. It was found in spring exuding
from the leaves of a species of costus on which
the goats delighted to feed. As they pastured among
the plants the gum attached itself to their beards
and the long hair about their legs, from whence
it was removed by the goatherds, who melted and
strained it like honey, after which it was rolled up
into balls and sold to the merchants. Sometimes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>however, a number of cords were thrown over the
shrubs, about which the gum collected.</p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to the above, the islands furnished
numerous other commodities, such as onions,<a id='r2205' /><a href='#f2205' class='c014'><sup>[2205]</sup></a> of

Snails,<a id='r2250' /><a href='#f2250' class='c014'><sup>[2250]</sup></a> which formed an important article in the
materia medica of the ancients, were exported from
Chios and Astypalæa,<a id='r2251' /><a href='#f2251' class='c014'><sup>[2251]</sup></a> a small island among the
Sporades,<a id='r2252' /><a href='#f2252' class='c014'><sup>[2252]</sup></a> which likewise carried on a considerable

Thasos furnished the sculptors of Greece with a
fine white marble which constituted the material
of two celebrated statues of the Emperor Adrian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>at Athens.<a id='r2255' /><a href='#f2255' class='c014'><sup>[2255]</sup></a> The marble of Chios was dead black,
like the obsidian stone, and slightly transparent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cerinthos in Eubœa, furnished a sort of light dry
earth,<a id='r2256' /><a href='#f2256' class='c014'><sup>[2256]</sup></a> used to preserve corn in granaries. Malta
supplied the idle and luxurious ladies of Greece
with a domestic kind of lap-dogs.<a id='r2257' /><a href='#f2257' class='c014'><sup>[2257]</sup></a> Sciathos was
famous for its mullets; Melos exported kids;<a id='r2258' /><a href='#f2258' class='c014'><sup>[2258]</sup></a> Naxos

and doves.<a id='r2261' /><a href='#f2261' class='c014'><sup>[2261]</sup></a> Among the wild and almost inaccessible
cliffs of modern Crete is found a species of
blue nightingale,<a id='r2262' /><a href='#f2262' class='c014'><sup>[2262]</sup></a> in size somewhat inferior to the
thrush, which it resembled in the richness and variety
of its notes. This bird is often caught and
kept in cages, where it is sometimes taught to imitate
the human voice. Occasionally it forms an
article of traffic, and is exported into Italy; but if
the ancients traded in these birds, the passage in
which it may be mentioned has escaped me. In
the same island is found an elegant sort of merops
which darts in flocks along the sides of the thymy
mountains in pursuit of the bees, which delight in
those fragrant places. It is of rich and variegated
plumage like the parrokeet. The children take it in
a very ingenious manner; passing a crooked pin with
a fine thread attached through the hard corslet of the
cicada, they let go the insect which mounts, thus transfixed,
into the air. The merops, bold and voracious,
immediately pounces upon and gorges it, when the
pin sticks in the throat, the bird becomes hooked like
a fish, and is easily drawn down and taken.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>The next branch of Greek commerce which demands
our notice was that carried on with the
countries on the Adriatic, Italy, Sicily, Sardinia,
Gaul, and Spain. This trade was in most instances
of later origin than that maintained with
regions lying more to the East, but nevertheless
came at length to be of considerable importance,
especially after the Hellenic colonies in Italy and
Sicily had risen to eminence. The cities founded,
moreover, on the coasts of Illyria exercised considerable
influence over the commerce of Greece, by
imparting to the rude natives a taste for her productions
and manufactures, and exciting them to
the exercise of greater industry to supply suitable
commodities in their turn. Nevertheless, the information
we possess on this subject is extremely
scanty.</p>

<p class='c001'>The barn-door fowls of these regions,<a id='r2263' /><a href='#f2263' class='c014'><sup>[2263]</sup></a> though inferior
to those of Greece, and of a smaller size,
were yet exported thither, simply because they were
foreign, while the natives on the contrary were
eager to enrich their country with the breed of
Attica. Wild turnips and parsnips,<a id='r2264' /><a href='#f2264' class='c014'><sup>[2264]</sup></a> it has been
remarked by the ancients, were found growing in
Dalmatia;<a id='r2265' /><a href='#f2265' class='c014'><sup>[2265]</sup></a> but as they abound in most other
countries, it seems not unreasonable to infer, from
this particular mentioned of them, that they were
exported.<a id='r2266' /><a href='#f2266' class='c014'><sup>[2266]</sup></a> The best iris, the odoriferous roots of
which were much used in the making of perfume,
came from the interior of Illyria,<a id='r2267' /><a href='#f2267' class='c014'><sup>[2267]</sup></a> where, having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>been dug up and cleared of the leaves, they were
strung on a linen cord and dried in the shade.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the same country also were obtained the
aspalathos<a id='r2268' /><a href='#f2268' class='c014'><sup>[2268]</sup></a> and the wild spikenard,<a id='r2269' /><a href='#f2269' class='c014'><sup>[2269]</sup></a> whose leaf resembled
that of the ivy, though somewhat smaller
and rounder. The wines of the Adriatic shore were
in no great request. That which was called Prætutian<a id='r2270' /><a href='#f2270' class='c014'><sup>[2270]</sup></a>
was light and aromatic, and therefore deceived
those who drank of it, being powerfully intoxicating
and somniferous. The wines of Istria partook of the
same character.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the city of Apollonia<a id='r2271' /><a href='#f2271' class='c014'><sup>[2271]</sup></a> was exported the
substance called pissasphaltos,<a id='r2272' /><a href='#f2272' class='c014'><sup>[2272]</sup></a> brought down by the
river from the Ceraunian mountains, and found in
large lumps upon the shore. It exhaled a mingled
odour of pitch and bitumen. Great quantities of
salt<a id='r2273' /><a href='#f2273' class='c014'><sup>[2273]</sup></a> were made in another part of Illyria, where,
during the spring, they took of the water of a stream
flowing forth from a cleft in the rock and poured it
into shallow pits exposed apparently to the sun and
air, where it hardened in about five days into salt.
The beans of Apollonia were famous for keeping
long.<a id='r2274' /><a href='#f2274' class='c014'><sup>[2274]</sup></a> Other Illyrian commodities were slaves, ampelitis,<a id='r2275' /><a href='#f2275' class='c014'><sup>[2275]</sup></a>
cattle, and skins, for which the natives
received wine and oil, and other productions of
civilised countries in return.<a id='r2276' /><a href='#f2276' class='c014'><sup>[2276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The wines of ancient Italy, which formed an important
article in the commerce of that country,<a id='r2277' /><a href='#f2277' class='c014'><sup>[2277]</sup></a>
are so familiar to most persons that it will be sufficient
barely to enumerate the principal of them,—as
the Falernian, the Cæcuban,<a id='r2278' /><a href='#f2278' class='c014'><sup>[2278]</sup></a> the Alban, the Surrentine,
the Brundusian, and the Antheia, a Thurian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>wine.<a id='r2279' /><a href='#f2279' class='c014'><sup>[2279]</sup></a> Of medicinal herbs and substances, Italy
exported considerable quantities, and among them
were the hyssop,<a id='r2280' /><a href='#f2280' class='c014'><sup>[2280]</sup></a> the melilot,<a id='r2281' /><a href='#f2281' class='c014'><sup>[2281]</sup></a> from the country
round Nola, the wild spikenard,<a id='r2282' /><a href='#f2282' class='c014'><sup>[2282]</sup></a> the madder,<a id='r2283' /><a href='#f2283' class='c014'><sup>[2283]</sup></a> cultivated
in the neighbourhood of Ravenna, and Celtic
spikenard from the Ligurian Alps,<a id='r2284' /><a href='#f2284' class='c014'><sup>[2284]</sup></a> which was
kept tied up in handfuls, together with its roots.
Of this article vast quantities, as much it is said as
sixty tons per annum, were in the last century exported
from hence into the inland parts of Africa,
as Æthiopia and Abyssinia,<a id='r2285' /><a href='#f2285' class='c014'><sup>[2285]</sup></a> where it was chiefly
used in softening and rendering shining the skin.
Another export of Italy was the Ligurian all-heal,<a id='r2286' /><a href='#f2286' class='c014'><sup>[2286]</sup></a>
from the lofty and umbrageous summits of the Apennines,
where it flourished chiefly along the edge
of the water-courses.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was in this same mountainous district a
species of snail,<a id='r2287' /><a href='#f2287' class='c014'><sup>[2287]</sup></a> furnished with a shell in winter,
which appears to have been both eaten and used
as a medicine.</p>

<p class='c001'>In many parts of Italy they still make use of
snails for the same purpose, digging them up out
of the earth with an iron instrument. The ancients
kept tame snails for eating, which they fatted with
a mixture of flour and sweet wine.<a id='r2288' /><a href='#f2288' class='c014'><sup>[2288]</sup></a> In France
they are still fed on vine leaves<a id='r2289' /><a href='#f2289' class='c014'><sup>[2289]</sup></a> in cages, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>they attain an immense size. Connoisseurs in snails
find a great difference in their flesh, according to
the plants and trees on which they pasture. Those
which attach themselves to the wormword plant are
bitter, while such as are found among calamint,
pennyroyal, and origany, have an extremely agreeable
flavour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the delicacies of Italy best known to the
ancients, and doubtless exported, were mushrooms,<a id='r2290' /><a href='#f2290' class='c014'><sup>[2290]</sup></a>
of which several excellent sorts are still produced;
those particularly which the Tuscans call Prignoli
and Porcini, which, being boiled and afterwards
dredged with flour and fried, are exceedingly savoury.<a id='r2291' /><a href='#f2291' class='c014'><sup>[2291]</sup></a>
The real Porcini are salted and preserved
with peculiar care, to be eaten during Lent and
other fasts.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are found in the kingdom of Naples certain
stones,<a id='r2292' /><a href='#f2292' class='c014'><sup>[2292]</sup></a> which being sunk in the ground, covered
with a thin layer of earth, and irrigated with warm
water, produce mushrooms in four days. These
stones are preserved both at Rome and at Naples
in cellars, for the production of mushrooms. Occasionally,
however, contrivances of this sort prove
fatal. In a convent in France where the nuns cultivated
mushrooms on a hot bed in a cellar, the
noisome exhalations destroyed several persons sent
down to collect them.<a id='r2293' /><a href='#f2293' class='c014'><sup>[2293]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It has been seen that the yew-tree of Arcadia
was much used by cabinet-makers; but the Italian
yew<a id='r2294' /><a href='#f2294' class='c014'><sup>[2294]</sup></a> is mentioned by Greek botanists only for its
singular and noxious properties, since the birds, they
inform us, which ate of its berries turned black,
while men were afflicted with troublesome diseases.
Around that of Gaul the imagination had woven a
tissue of terrors almost equal to that which modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>times have cast about the upas; for, to sleep, or
even to recline, beneath its shade, was supposed to
cause dangerous maladies and occasionally even death.</p>

<p class='c001'>The plant of most deadly qualities known to the
ancients grew plentifully in the mountains of the
Vestini, neighbours of the Sabines.<a id='r2295' /><a href='#f2295' class='c014'><sup>[2295]</sup></a> It was identical
in nature with that of Pontos, and many extraordinary
circumstances are related of its effects. By
the mere touch it was said to possess the power to
benumb the scorpion, which again recovered its
activity if brought in contact with the hellebore.
It was used by hunters in the chace to destroy
wild beasts, and by physicians for various purposes.
At present it appears to be found chiefly among
the recesses of the Rhætian Alps, from whence it
passes to the Papal States and the kingdom of
Naples, in both which countries there is a particular
class of men whose sole occupation is the
extirpation of wolves, and who formerly used to
sell this poison openly on the bridge of St. Angelo,
at Rome.<a id='r2296' /><a href='#f2296' class='c014'><sup>[2296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the other exports of Italy may be enumerated
the squills of Minturnæ,<a id='r2297' /><a href='#f2297' class='c014'><sup>[2297]</sup></a> which exceeded
in size those of Smyrna, and the lobsters of Alexandria:
amber, too, and coal, of which there are
said to have been mines in Liguria,<a id='r2298' /><a href='#f2298' class='c014'><sup>[2298]</sup></a> found their
way into the channels of commerce. The amber of
the Po existed only in the regions of mythology.<a id='r2299' /><a href='#f2299' class='c014'><sup>[2299]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Calabria supplied pitch,<a id='r2300' /><a href='#f2300' class='c014'><sup>[2300]</sup></a> and bronze from Temessa;<a id='r2301' /><a href='#f2301' class='c014'><sup>[2301]</sup></a>

Campania, wheat, from which the best gruel
was made, zea, and panic.<a id='r2311' /><a href='#f2311' class='c014'><sup>[2311]</sup></a> Northern Italy, which
abounded in forests, reared immense droves of pigs,
which were fed on acorns, so that Rome was almost
entirely supplied from thence with pork and
bacon.<a id='r2312' /><a href='#f2312' class='c014'><sup>[2312]</sup></a> It likewise exported millet, pitch,<a id='r2313' /><a href='#f2313' class='c014'><sup>[2313]</sup></a> exceedingly
fine wool from the neighbourhood of Mutina and
the banks of the Scultenna,<a id='r2314' /><a href='#f2314' class='c014'><sup>[2314]</sup></a> long coarse wool from
Liguria and the country of the Symbri,<a id='r2315' /><a href='#f2315' class='c014'><sup>[2315]</sup></a> with a middling
sort from the neighbourhood of Padua, with
which coats, carpets, with several varieties of shaggy
cloth, were manufactured.<a id='r2316' /><a href='#f2316' class='c014'><sup>[2316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This part of Italy, likewise, produced immense
quantities of wine, which the inhabitants laid up in
tuns as large as dwelling-houses.<a id='r2317' /><a href='#f2317' class='c014'><sup>[2317]</sup></a> Gold mines were
anciently worked in the country of the Vercelli.<a id='r2318' /><a href='#f2318' class='c014'><sup>[2318]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The chief exports of Sicily were wheat,<a id='r2319' /><a href='#f2319' class='c014'><sup>[2319]</sup></a> of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>the best and cleanest came from the neighbourhood
of Agrigentum;<a id='r2320' /><a href='#f2320' class='c014'><sup>[2320]</sup></a> cheese,<a id='r2321' /><a href='#f2321' class='c014'><sup>[2321]</sup></a> which appears to have been

as the days of Polyphemos; hogs,<a id='r2322' /><a href='#f2322' class='c014'><sup>[2322]</sup></a> pigeons, and doves,<a id='r2323' /><a href='#f2323' class='c014'><sup>[2323]</sup></a>
whose chief haunt was about the temple of Aphroditè<a id='r2324' /><a href='#f2324' class='c014'><sup>[2324]</sup></a>
on Mount Eryx; variegated robes,<a id='r2325' /><a href='#f2325' class='c014'><sup>[2325]</sup></a> costly furniture,
more particularly plate and pillows,<a id='r2326' /><a href='#f2326' class='c014'><sup>[2326]</sup></a> and superbly
wrought chariots.<a id='r2327' /><a href='#f2327' class='c014'><sup>[2327]</sup></a> The Sicilian saffron,<a id='r2328' /><a href='#f2328' class='c014'><sup>[2328]</sup></a> grown
in the neighbourhood of Centuripa was of an inferior
quality, but seems nevertheless to have been
imported into Italy,<a id='r2329' /><a href='#f2329' class='c014'><sup>[2329]</sup></a> where it is supposed to have
been applied to the dyeing of the cedar beams used
in the construction of temples.</p>

<p class='c001'>The honey of Mount Hybla,<a id='r2330' /><a href='#f2330' class='c014'><sup>[2330]</sup></a> celebrated through
all antiquity, constituted another important article
of commerce, as did likewise, more particularly, the
Adrian and the Mamertinian.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the better known plants of Sicily were
the marjoram,<a id='r2331' /><a href='#f2331' class='c014'><sup>[2331]</sup></a> and the cactus, the latter of which
was eaten, whether fresh or pickled.<a id='r2332' /><a href='#f2332' class='c014'><sup>[2332]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From the neighbourhood of Tetras, was obtained
a sort of stone which became light and porous in
burning so as to resemble the pumice.<a id='r2333' /><a href='#f2333' class='c014'><sup>[2333]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>About the Erinæan promontory a species of jet
was found in great plenty, which when burnt emitted
a bituminous odour.<a id='r2334' /><a href='#f2334' class='c014'><sup>[2334]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Sicily likewise exported salt,<a id='r2335' /><a href='#f2335' class='c014'><sup>[2335]</sup></a> emeralds,<a id='r2336' /><a href='#f2336' class='c014'><sup>[2336]</sup></a> lapis specularis,<a id='r2337' /><a href='#f2337' class='c014'><sup>[2337]</sup></a>
and agates.<a id='r2338' /><a href='#f2338' class='c014'><sup>[2338]</sup></a> An abundant supply of coral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>was obtained from the sea around Cape Pachynos,
near Syracuse;<a id='r2339' /><a href='#f2339' class='c014'><sup>[2339]</sup></a> and from Agrigentum, a liquid bitumen
found floating on the clear surface of fountains
and burnt instead of oil in lamps, and therefore called
by some the oil of Sicily.<a id='r2340' /><a href='#f2340' class='c014'><sup>[2340]</sup></a> Poisons of great force
were also found in the island. Among the favourite
dishes of the ancients were the lampreys and eels
of the Pharo of Messina,<a id='r2341' /><a href='#f2341' class='c014'><sup>[2341]</sup></a> the bellies of thunnies
caught near Cape Pachynos,<a id='r2342' /><a href='#f2342' class='c014'><sup>[2342]</sup></a> snails,<a id='r2343' /><a href='#f2343' class='c014'><sup>[2343]</sup></a> and oysters from
Cape Peloros.<a id='r2344' /><a href='#f2344' class='c014'><sup>[2344]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Lipari islands exported sulphur,<a id='r2345' /><a href='#f2345' class='c014'><sup>[2345]</sup></a> alum,<a id='r2346' /><a href='#f2346' class='c014'><sup>[2346]</sup></a> reddle,

of a superior quality; Sardinia, carnelians,<a id='r2351' /><a href='#f2351' class='c014'><sup>[2351]</sup></a> snails,<a id='r2352' /><a href='#f2352' class='c014'><sup>[2352]</sup></a>
salt provisions,<a id='r2353' /><a href='#f2353' class='c014'><sup>[2353]</sup></a> wax,<a id='r2354' /><a href='#f2354' class='c014'><sup>[2354]</sup></a> and honey, which though bitter,
because the bee there fed on wormwood, was much
used in cosmetics. In this island likewise was found
the seseli,<a id='r2355' /><a href='#f2355' class='c014'><sup>[2355]</sup></a> the juice of which, extracted from the
root, was set to thicken in the shade, because, exposed
to the sun, it evaporated altogether. It was
esteemed a cure for the toothache. The persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>employed in collecting it were careful to anoint their
beard and nostrils with oil of roses, in order to escape
those pains and vertigoes which would otherwise
have been caused by its effluvia. The little island
of Elba exported iron ore and a precious stone richly
sprinkled with brilliant colours.<a id='r2356' /><a href='#f2356' class='c014'><sup>[2356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With Gaul Greece carried on no great trade. The
few articles which it thence obtained were hams,
reckoned among the best in the ancient world,<a id='r2357' /><a href='#f2357' class='c014'><sup>[2357]</sup></a> pitch,<a id='r2358' /><a href='#f2358' class='c014'><sup>[2358]</sup></a>
larch, resin,<a id='r2359' /><a href='#f2359' class='c014'><sup>[2359]</sup></a> wool; French lavender, from the island
of Hieres; wormwood from Xaintonges;<a id='r2360' /><a href='#f2360' class='c014'><sup>[2360]</sup></a> seseli,<a id='r2361' /><a href='#f2361' class='c014'><sup>[2361]</sup></a>
whetstones called passernices,<a id='r2362' /><a href='#f2362' class='c014'><sup>[2362]</sup></a> and carbuncles
from Marseilles, which were so highly esteemed, that
a stone of very small size sold for fifty pieces of
gold.<a id='r2363' /><a href='#f2363' class='c014'><sup>[2363]</sup></a> In the environs of Ruscino<a id='r2364' /><a href='#f2364' class='c014'><sup>[2364]</sup></a> a very fine sort
of mullet was caught in certain sandy lagoons near
the sea. Aquitania produced gold; Belgium a sort
of white stone (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pierre franche</i></span>) which was sawed into
tiles more easily than wood, and used for mosaics.<a id='r2365' /><a href='#f2365' class='c014'><sup>[2365]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The produce of Spain and Portugal was richer
and more varied: merino rams<a id='r2366' /><a href='#f2366' class='c014'><sup>[2366]</sup></a> for breeding, valued at
two hundred and forty pounds, were thence imported
into Greece, together with wool of the very finest
quality.<a id='r2367' /><a href='#f2367' class='c014'><sup>[2367]</sup></a> At an earlier period superior cloth had
been manufactured for exportation.<a id='r2368' /><a href='#f2368' class='c014'><sup>[2368]</sup></a> The linen of
Emporiæ and of the Saltiæti long continued to
be famous.<a id='r2369' /><a href='#f2369' class='c014'><sup>[2369]</sup></a> The kermes<a id='r2370' /><a href='#f2370' class='c014'><sup>[2370]</sup></a> procured from Spain
were of an inferior quality, but they always continued
to be an article of commerce,<a id='r2371' /><a href='#f2371' class='c014'><sup>[2371]</sup></a> as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>the alum,<a id='r2372' /><a href='#f2372' class='c014'><sup>[2372]</sup></a> the slate used in medicine, the whetstone,<a id='r2373' /><a href='#f2373' class='c014'><sup>[2373]</sup></a>
lapis specularis,<a id='r2374' /><a href='#f2374' class='c014'><sup>[2374]</sup></a> the sory,<a id='r2375' /><a href='#f2375' class='c014'><sup>[2375]</sup></a> minium,<a id='r2376' /><a href='#f2376' class='c014'><sup>[2376]</sup></a> and palmati,
round pebbles having within the figure of a
palm-tree, found near Munda.<a id='r2377' /><a href='#f2377' class='c014'><sup>[2377]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The cinnabar<a id='r2378' /><a href='#f2378' class='c014'><sup>[2378]</sup></a> of this country was artificial,<a id='r2379' /><a href='#f2379' class='c014'><sup>[2379]</sup></a> and
produced from the mixture of a certain ore and argentiferous
sand, which being cast into furnaces assumed
a most brilliant and flame-like colour. In
the mines the above ore emitted so pestilential a
vapour that, to protect themselves from it, the workmen
covered their faces with a mask of transparent
bladders, which at once guarded their eyes and prevented
their inhaling it, until by their own breath it
had been somewhat tempered. This pigment was
used by artists in painting the most costly and
gorgeous frescoes.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has often been remarked that Spain<a id='r2380' /><a href='#f2380' class='c014'><sup>[2380]</sup></a> was to
the ancient world what Peru and Mexico afterwards
were to Spain. Gold and silver abounded almost
throughout the land. The miners in constant working
were numerous; the rivers and mountain-torrents
rolled down golden sands; and frequently after floods
morsels of this precious metal were discovered flashing
and glittering among the rocks and stones.<a id='r2381' /><a href='#f2381' class='c014'><sup>[2381]</sup></a> Silver
was so plentiful, that the natives applied it to
the most common uses, and the Phœnicians and
Greeks who first touched upon the shore not only
freighted their ships with it, but absolutely cast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>away their anchors and supplied their place with
masses of silver.<a id='r2382' /><a href='#f2382' class='c014'><sup>[2382]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The large and opulent province of Bætica, now
Andalusia, supplied the ancient world with numerous
valuable commodities, among which were wheat,<a id='r2383' /><a href='#f2383' class='c014'><sup>[2383]</sup></a>
wine,<a id='r2384' /><a href='#f2384' class='c014'><sup>[2384]</sup></a> oil,<a id='r2385' /><a href='#f2385' class='c014'><sup>[2385]</sup></a> bees’ wax, honey, pitch,<a id='r2386' /><a href='#f2386' class='c014'><sup>[2386]</sup></a> kermes,<a id='r2387' /><a href='#f2387' class='c014'><sup>[2387]</sup></a> vermilion
not inferior to that of Sinopè,<a id='r2388' /><a href='#f2388' class='c014'><sup>[2388]</sup></a> rock-salt, and excellent
salt-fish.<a id='r2389' /><a href='#f2389' class='c014'><sup>[2389]</sup></a> The thunnies of this part of Spain
were said to fatten, like droves of wild hogs,<a id='r2390' /><a href='#f2390' class='c014'><sup>[2390]</sup></a> on the
large acorns of the dwarf oak which grew plentifully
along the coast, and dipped its fruit into the sea.
Hence, too, were obtained numerous species of shellfish,
among which were conchs of enormous size.<a id='r2391' /><a href='#f2391' class='c014'><sup>[2391]</sup></a>
The congers and murænas, likewise, attained extraordinary
dimensions, some of them weighing no
less than eighteen minæ, while polypi were found
a full talent in weight, and cuttle-fish a yard in
length.<a id='r2392' /><a href='#f2392' class='c014'><sup>[2392]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Spartium, or Spanish broom, principally used
in the manufacture of ropes<a id='r2393' /><a href='#f2393' class='c014'><sup>[2393]</sup></a> and cables, grew chiefly<a id='r2394' /><a href='#f2394' class='c014'><sup>[2394]</sup></a>
along the high and arid plains of Valentia and Catalonia,
through which passed the great high road
from Italy.<a id='r2395' /><a href='#f2395' class='c014'><sup>[2395]</sup></a> Spain exported, besides, cumin, together
with wild rocket,<a id='r2396' /><a href='#f2396' class='c014'><sup>[2396]</sup></a> which grew chiefly on
the shores of the Atlantic.<a id='r2397' /><a href='#f2397' class='c014'><sup>[2397]</sup></a> The seeds were substituted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>by the natives for mustard. In fact, we find
that it was a common practice among the ancients
to use the seed of rocket in seasoning their dishes;
and in order to preserve it for constant use they
reduced it with milk or vinegar to a kind of paste,
which they fashioned into round cakes, and laid up
when dry.</p>

<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Enfin tirant du côté de la mer,
nous nous trouvâmes sur des
collines sèches et sablonneuses,
couvertes de ces petits arbrisseaux
qui fournissent le ladanum.
C’étoit dans la plus
grande chaleur du jour, et il ne
faisoit pas de vent: cette disposition
du temps est nécessaire
pour amasser le ladanum.
Sept ou huit paysans en chemise
et en caleçon, rouloient
leurs fouets sur ces plantes: à
force de les secouer et de les
frotter sur les feuilles de cet
arbuste, leurs courroyes se
chargeoient d’une espèce de glu
odoriférante, attachée sur les
feuilles; c’est une partie du suc
nourricier de la plante, lequel
transude au travers de la tissure
de ces feuilles comme une
sueur grasse, dont les gouttes
sont luisantes, et aussi claires
que la térébenthine. Lorsque
les fouets sont bien chargez de
cette graisse on en ratisse les
courroyes avec un couteau, et
l’on met en pains ce que l’on
eu détache: c’est ce que nous
recevons sous le nom de ladanum.”

</div>

<p class='c013'>Having thus cast a rapid glance over the principal
articles, natural or artificial, which commerce derived
from Europe and Asia Minor, we shall pass over into
Africa, in order, as nearly as possible, to ascertain
what that part of the world contributed to the trade
of antiquity. We shall then proceed by way of
Egypt into Syria and Arabia, and from thence to
Persia, India, and the farther regions of Asia, with
which we will conclude our view of the commerce
of the Greeks. Numerous articles of merchandise
of the highest value were, from very early ages,
obtained from Africa;<a id='r2398' /><a href='#f2398' class='c014'><sup>[2398]</sup></a> as gold in ingots, and gold
dust, ivory,<a id='r2399' /><a href='#f2399' class='c014'><sup>[2399]</sup></a> blocks of ebony and black slaves.<a id='r2400' /><a href='#f2400' class='c014'><sup>[2400]</sup></a> The
ancients have remarked, that a piece of green ebony
placed near the fire kindled, and rubbed against a
stone assumed a reddish colour.<a id='r2401' /><a href='#f2401' class='c014'><sup>[2401]</sup></a> In some parts of
the country elephants’ teeth were so plentiful, that
the very cattle-sheds were enclosed with palings of
ivory;<a id='r2402' /><a href='#f2402' class='c014'><sup>[2402]</sup></a> and the present of the Æthiopians to the
Persian king<a id='r2403' /><a href='#f2403' class='c014'><sup>[2403]</sup></a> consisted of twelve elephants’ teeth,
two hundred blocks of ebony, five black slaves, and
a quantity of unwrought gold.<a id='r2404' /><a href='#f2404' class='c014'><sup>[2404]</sup></a> From this country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>were exported linen or flax, medicinal roots, perfumes,
and aromatic spices.<a id='r2405' /><a href='#f2405' class='c014'><sup>[2405]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>According to the information furnished to Herodotus
by the Carthaginians, there was anciently a
lake in the small island of Kerkenna, out of which
the young women drew up gold dust with bunches
of feathers.<a id='r2406' /><a href='#f2406' class='c014'><sup>[2406]</sup></a> Africa, likewise, supplied alum,<a id='r2407' /><a href='#f2407' class='c014'><sup>[2407]</sup></a> salt,<a id='r2408' /><a href='#f2408' class='c014'><sup>[2408]</sup></a>

<p class='c001'>A purple, rivalling that of Tyre,<a id='r2414' /><a href='#f2414' class='c014'><sup>[2414]</sup></a> was produced
from a fish caught along the northern coast. Hence,
also, were obtained kermes<a id='r2415' /><a href='#f2415' class='c014'><sup>[2415]</sup></a> and ostrich feathers,
with which the crests of helmets were sometimes
adorned. Monkeys<a id='r2416' /><a href='#f2416' class='c014'><sup>[2416]</sup></a> were commonly imported from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>Africa, together with Æthiopian sheep, a species of
fowl,<a id='r2417' /><a href='#f2417' class='c014'><sup>[2417]</sup></a> and various kinds of locusts<a id='r2418' /><a href='#f2418' class='c014'><sup>[2418]</sup></a> which, eaten by
the inhabitants only, figured among the materia
medica of the Greeks. Dried and burnt, their smoke
was snuffed up for certain complaints, and, reduced
to powder, they were drunk in Rome as a remedy
against the bite of a scorpion.<a id='r2419' /><a href='#f2419' class='c014'><sup>[2419]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Slabs of citron-wood, used principally in the making
of tables, seem to have been obtained exclusively
from this part of the world,<a id='r2420' /><a href='#f2420' class='c014'><sup>[2420]</sup></a> which, likewise, furnished
various kinds of beautiful marbles. Fine carbuncles
for seals were obtained from the neighbourhood
of Carthage,<a id='r2421' /><a href='#f2421' class='c014'><sup>[2421]</sup></a> as were the emerald and the
bastard emerald from a small island called Cothon,
opposite that part of the coast.</p>

<p class='c001'>The gum ammoniac distils in a milky juice<a id='r2422' /><a href='#f2422' class='c014'><sup>[2422]</sup></a> from
an umbelliferous plant growing in the desert near the
oracle of Jupiter Ammon, as well as on the confines
of Cyrenè, whence it appears to have been chiefly
exported.<a id='r2423' /><a href='#f2423' class='c014'><sup>[2423]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the same country grew the silphion,<a id='r2424' /><a href='#f2424' class='c014'><sup>[2424]</sup></a> which,
according to tradition, was not indigenous to the
soil, but sprang up suddenly for the first time after
a violent tempest.<a id='r2425' /><a href='#f2425' class='c014'><sup>[2425]</sup></a> If we can rely on this relation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>we must suppose the seed to have been borne thither
by the winds, probably from some part of the interior.
Both the root and the juice were exported,
sometimes adulterated with bean-flowers or gum sagapenum.
Marmarica supplied an extremely pungent
kind of capparis,<a id='r2426' /><a href='#f2426' class='c014'><sup>[2426]</sup></a> which, also, was found on the

<p class='c001'>The euphorbium,<a id='r2439' /><a href='#f2439' class='c014'><sup>[2439]</sup></a> which received its name from
Euphorbius, physician to king Juba, who discovered
the virtues of its juices, is found on Mount Atlas,
and in most parts of northern Africa. In procuring
this substance they spread a number of sheepskins
round the shrub, which they then pierced with darts
or lances from a distance, in order to avoid the
penetrating noxious vapours which exhaled from it
at its first coming in contact with the air. The
same precaution, according to a modern traveller, is
still practised.</p>

<p class='c001'>Carthage traded generally in all the productions
of the ancient world, her exports consequently were
numerous, and among these were magnificent tapestry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>and richly figured pillows.<a id='r2440' /><a href='#f2440' class='c014'><sup>[2440]</sup></a> From the same

Phœnicia, where they were employed in constructing
the sides of citharæ.<a id='r2446' /><a href='#f2446' class='c014'><sup>[2446]</sup></a> The scink, whose flesh
was used as an antidote and in aphrodisiacs, was
exported from the neighbourhood of mount Atlas,
where it attained the length of four feet and a
half.<a id='r2447' /><a href='#f2447' class='c014'><sup>[2447]</sup></a> The Carthaginians, who sailed down the
western shore of Africa to the gold coast, used to
trade with the natives without personal communication.
Landing from their ships they deposited
a quantity of merchandise on the ground and retired
on board, where they kindled large fires, that
their coming might be announced by the smoke;
upon this the natives approached, and laid close by
what they conceived to be the value of the articles
in gold. If what they brought satisfied the Carthaginians,
they took away the gold and left the merchandise;
if not, they suffered the whole to remain;
upon which the natives added a quantity of the
precious metal, until the strangers were satisfied.<a id='r2448' /><a href='#f2448' class='c014'><sup>[2448]</sup></a>
Similar rules are observed by the Moors in trading
with the negroes in various parts of this continent.</p>

<p class='c001'>On nearly the whole coast of northern Africa
flourished the lotus tree, the fruit of which constituted
the principal subsistence of some of the
natives, who likewise made from it a kind of wine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>which could not be exported, since it turned sour
in three days. The nourishing quality of this fruit
was experienced by the army of Ophella,<a id='r2449' /><a href='#f2449' class='c014'><sup>[2449]</sup></a> which
proceeding across the desert, to attack the Carthaginians,
was reduced to subsist upon it entirely for
several days. It is about the size of a white cherry
and straw-coloured, excepting on the side next the
sun, which has a ruddy blush: the best are said
to be without stones, but those which are produced
in the Saïd have very large ones. Whether it has
yet been introduced into England I know not; I
myself, however, made the attempt in pots placed
in a warm room; but on the first frosty night of
autumn the plants perished entirely, with all the
silk trees I had planted at the same time. From
the same part of the country was obtained the lotus
plant, used in cosmetics and medicines.<a id='r2450' /><a href='#f2450' class='c014'><sup>[2450]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From Egypt, which we shall here consider apart
from the rest of Africa, the most valuable exports
were undoubtedly wheat<a id='r2451' /><a href='#f2451' class='c014'><sup>[2451]</sup></a> and rice,<a id='r2452' /><a href='#f2452' class='c014'><sup>[2452]</sup></a> after which,
in later ages, the wines of Lake Mareotis,<a id='r2453' /><a href='#f2453' class='c014'><sup>[2453]</sup></a> and several
cities along the Nile, deserve to be enumerated.
The seeds of the bitter cabbage of Egypt<a id='r2454' /><a href='#f2454' class='c014'><sup>[2454]</sup></a>
were exported to be employed in medicine. Marjoram,

<p class='c001'>It is possible, that the sensitive plant was introduced
into Greece from Egypt, since this appears
to be the native country of all the acacia
tribe, to which the sensitive plant belongs; and we
find it to have been plentifully produced in the
neighbourhood of Memphis.<a id='r2467' /><a href='#f2467' class='c014'><sup>[2467]</sup></a> Both the seeds and
flowers of the tamarisk were used in medicine,<a id='r2468' /><a href='#f2468' class='c014'><sup>[2468]</sup></a>

to impart a medicinal virtue to whatever

<p class='c001'>From dill,<a id='r2469' /><a href='#f2469' class='c014'><sup>[2469]</sup></a> which was exported from Egypt and

supposed to mitigate the acuteness of the headache.
Other kinds of perfume<a id='r2470' /><a href='#f2470' class='c014'><sup>[2470]</sup></a> were likewise
manufactured in this country,<a id='r2471' /><a href='#f2471' class='c014'><sup>[2471]</sup></a> of which that called

<p class='c001'>Egypt, likewise, exported paper,<a id='r2474' /><a href='#f2474' class='c014'><sup>[2474]</sup></a> sails, curiously

provisions.<a id='r2484' /><a href='#f2484' class='c014'><sup>[2484]</sup></a> The scink, or land crocodile, was likewise
furnished by Egypt.<a id='r2485' /><a href='#f2485' class='c014'><sup>[2485]</sup></a> The game-cocks of Alexandria,
which appear to have been held in the highest estimation
were doubtless exported.<a id='r2486' /><a href='#f2486' class='c014'><sup>[2486]</sup></a> The Egyptian oil
stunk because no salt was used in the making of
it.<a id='r2487' /><a href='#f2487' class='c014'><sup>[2487]</sup></a> Upon the fields of Egypt, at the period of
the inundation, was found in great plenty the nymphæa
lotus, with its white flower, which was said
to remain open so long as the sun continued above
the horizon, but closed at the approach of twilight,
and dipped its whole head beneath the water,
where it remained concealed till sunrise, when it
rose and spread its petals to the dawn. The roots
of this plant, about the size of a quince, and in
taste like the yolk of an egg, when cooked, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>eaten by the Egyptians, who with its seed made
also a kind of bread.<a id='r2488' /><a href='#f2488' class='c014'><sup>[2488]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the minerals and precious stones obtained
from this country were the sory,<a id='r2489' /><a href='#f2489' class='c014'><sup>[2489]</sup></a> the bloodstone,<a id='r2490' /><a href='#f2490' class='c014'><sup>[2490]</sup></a> the
emerald,<a id='r2491' /><a href='#f2491' class='c014'><sup>[2491]</sup></a> and the carbuncle. Lapis lazuli was manufactured
in Egypt,<a id='r2492' /><a href='#f2492' class='c014'><sup>[2492]</sup></a> the secret of imitating nature
in the produce of this substance having been discovered
by one of its kings. In the neighbourhood
of Memphis was found a sort of variegated pebbles,
which, being broken and reduced to powder, were
used by surgeons when about to apply the knife
or the cautery in dulling the sense of pain, which
it effected completely without danger.<a id='r2493' /><a href='#f2493' class='c014'><sup>[2493]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The morochthos,<a id='r2494' /><a href='#f2494' class='c014'><sup>[2494]</sup></a> likewise used in medicine, was a
species of Egyptian clay applied to the bleaching
of linen. From Æthiopia came the stone called
thyites,<a id='r2495' /><a href='#f2495' class='c014'><sup>[2495]</sup></a> which, though green like the jasper, being
dipped in water, imparted to it the colour of milk,
and rendered it a cure for ophthalmia. The nitre<a id='r2496' /><a href='#f2496' class='c014'><sup>[2496]</sup></a> of
Egypt was superior to that of Lydia.<a id='r2497' /><a href='#f2497' class='c014'><sup>[2497]</sup></a> Aloes, likewise,<a id='r2498' /><a href='#f2498' class='c014'><sup>[2498]</sup></a>
and the fine sand for the gymnasia were
supplied by this country.<a id='r2499' /><a href='#f2499' class='c014'><sup>[2499]</sup></a> The best burnt copper
was exported from Egypt, where it was prepared
as follows in the neighbourhood of Memphis.<a id='r2500' /><a href='#f2500' class='c014'><sup>[2500]</sup></a> Taking
a number of copper nails from ships decayed
and fallen to pieces, they piled them in unbaked
jars, alternating with layers of earth and sulphur
of equal weight, which, having been well luted,
were then placed in red-hot furnaces, where they
were kept until the jars were thoroughly baked.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>In lieu of salt and sulphur alum was sometimes
substituted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Others, without adding any of these substances,
burnt the nails for several days; while a fourth
method was, previously to smear them with a mixture
of alum, vinegar, and sulphur, and afterwards
to burn them in unbaked jars. Copper thus calcined
assumed a red colour, and, when pounded in
Theban mortars and repeatedly washed with rain
water, resembled cinnabar or minium.<a id='r2501' /><a href='#f2501' class='c014'><sup>[2501]</sup></a> It was usually
kept by physicians in boxes of bronze. The
marbles of Egypt, used by ancient artists, were
generally green and red porphyry.<a id='r2502' /><a href='#f2502' class='c014'><sup>[2502]</sup></a> All kinds of
glass vessels, it is well known, were exported from
Alexandria.<a id='r2503' /><a href='#f2503' class='c014'><sup>[2503]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the commerce of ancient Syria, one of the
principal articles was dates,<a id='r2504' /><a href='#f2504' class='c014'><sup>[2504]</sup></a> whether dried in the
ordinary manner or pressed together and fashioned
into square masses. Figs,<a id='r2505' /><a href='#f2505' class='c014'><sup>[2505]</sup></a> likewise, with prunes,<a id='r2506' /><a href='#f2506' class='c014'><sup>[2506]</sup></a>
and walnuts,<a id='r2507' /><a href='#f2507' class='c014'><sup>[2507]</sup></a> and pomegranates,<a id='r2508' /><a href='#f2508' class='c014'><sup>[2508]</sup></a> and apples, and
nuts,<a id='r2509' /><a href='#f2509' class='c014'><sup>[2509]</sup></a> and almonds,<a id='r2510' /><a href='#f2510' class='c014'><sup>[2510]</sup></a> came from thence. With respect
to the exports of Phœnicia we can say but
little in this place, as it collected together the
wealth of the whole ancient world, which it again
distributed according to the tastes and wants of
various countries. Thus, we find, that from Egypt
the merchandise borne to Tyre consisted of fine
linen, with broidered work, which was used in sails
on her galleys; blue and purple from the Ægæan;
silver, iron, tin, and lead,<a id='r2511' /><a href='#f2511' class='c014'><sup>[2511]</sup></a> from Cilicia; slaves and
brazen vessels from Javan, Tubal, and Meschech;
horses and mules from Kùrdistân; ivory and ebony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>from the shores of the Persian gulf; emeralds,
purple and broidered work, fine linen, coral, and
agates, from Syria; wheat of Minnith and Pannag,
honey, oil, and balms, from Judea; and white wool
and the wine of Helbon from Damascus. Among
the other exports of Tyre were bright iron, cassia,
and calamus; Arabia furnished her with lambs,
rams, and goats, spices, precious stones, and gold,
blue cloths and broidered work, and chests of rich
apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar.<a id='r2512' /><a href='#f2512' class='c014'><sup>[2512]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From this country was first obtained the Marocco
leather which is no other than goat’s-skin tanned
with the bark of the pomegranate-tree.<a id='r2513' /><a href='#f2513' class='c014'><sup>[2513]</sup></a> The frankincense<a id='r2514' /><a href='#f2514' class='c014'><sup>[2514]</sup></a>
laid up in vast quantities in the sea-ports
of Syria to be conveyed to every country on the
shores of the Mediterranean, not having been the
growth of the country, will be described elsewhere;
but various other odoriferous substances, whether
gums, oils, or unguents, were the produce of their
land.<a id='r2515' /><a href='#f2515' class='c014'><sup>[2515]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among these was the balm of Gilead,<a id='r2516' /><a href='#f2516' class='c014'><sup>[2516]</sup></a> which
exuded from a tree originally introduced from Arabia
Felix. The gardens, two in number,<a id='r2517' /><a href='#f2517' class='c014'><sup>[2517]</sup></a> in which
the balsam trees were cultivated lay in the valley
of Jericho, flanked on both sides by continuous
ridges of lofty mountains,<a id='r2518' /><a href='#f2518' class='c014'><sup>[2518]</sup></a> and were of small dimensions,
the larger not exceeding twenty acres. The
tree itself, at present found to flourish in several
regions of the East, resembled in size that of the
pomegranate, spreading into numerous branches and
covered with an evergreen foliage, in form like the
leaves of rue, though in colour lighter. Its fruit
resembled the terebinth-berries both in hue and
size. The gum, for which alone it is valued, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>produced in extremely small quantities, but exhales
the most delicious odour.</p>

<p class='c001'>The season for gathering it in old times was during
the extremest heat of the dog-days, when an
incision being made with certain iron claws towards
the upper part of the trunk, the balsam trickled
forth slowly so as scarcely to fill a single shell
during the whole day, as was more particularly observed
during the visit of Alexander to this valley.
The produce of the large garden during the whole
year did not exceed six choes, that of the smaller
one a chous. The balsam, when it issued from the
tree, was liquid, somewhat resembling milk in colour,
and about the consistence of oil. It was sometimes
collected on flocks of wool and squeezed into
small horns, from whence it was transferred to fictile
vases. This substance was so fragrant that the
smallest particle perfumed the atmosphere to a considerable
distance. It is now seldom found unadulterated
in Europe. Pompey carried the balsam-tree
in his triumph at Rome, and Vespasian afterwards
brought another specimen into Italy.<a id='r2519' /><a href='#f2519' class='c014'><sup>[2519]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Syrian costus bore the third rank in the estimation
of the ancients, and the superior kinds
were adulterated with the roots of a species of
inula, growing in the district of Comagena.<a id='r2520' /><a href='#f2520' class='c014'><sup>[2520]</sup></a> Another
Syrian export was galbanum<a id='r2521' /><a href='#f2521' class='c014'><sup>[2521]</sup></a> which appears
to have been produced only in this country; another,
the speckled wake-robin,<a id='r2522' /><a href='#f2522' class='c014'><sup>[2522]</sup></a> the roots of which were
eaten like parsnips, while the leaves were salted
and used to season dishes. This appears to have
been one of the plants which formed the garland
of Ophelia, to which the queen alludes in the following
words:</p>

<p class='c001'>The calamus and sweet rush, found in many other

Palestine, where they grew in stagnant waters among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>the marshes bordering on Lake Gennesareth.<a id='r2544' /><a href='#f2544' class='c014'><sup>[2544]</sup></a> These
marshes, in summer dry, occupied a space of about
four miles in length, which seems of old to have
been thick with reeds and rushes. From the green
plants no perfume exhaled, but when they were
cut down and laid to dry in the sun there issued
from them a delicate fragrance which impregnated
the whole air, and, as some fabulously pretended,
could be detected by mariners approaching the
shore at a distance of more than a hundred and
fifty stadia.<a id='r2545' /><a href='#f2545' class='c014'><sup>[2545]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The cucumbers of Antioch were celebrated.<a id='r2546' /><a href='#f2546' class='c014'><sup>[2546]</sup></a> From
Syria was obtained the best terebinth-wood blacker
than ebony, used in making dagger-handles, and
turned into cups,<a id='r2547' /><a href='#f2547' class='c014'><sup>[2547]</sup></a> together with an artificial kind
of gypsum made by burning parget stones.<a id='r2548' /><a href='#f2548' class='c014'><sup>[2548]</sup></a> Near
Seleucia there were mines of an earth called ampelitis,<a id='r2549' /><a href='#f2549' class='c014'><sup>[2549]</sup></a>
of which the black was the most excellent,
resembling pitch; fine charcoal used, mixed with
oil, for blackening the eyebrows and dyeing the
hair. People likewise smeared with it the stems
of vines to protect them against the depredations
of insects.</p>

<p class='c001'>The best bitumen<a id='r2550' /><a href='#f2550' class='c014'><sup>[2550]</sup></a> was obtained from the environs
of the Dead Sea, in Palestine, and sometimes adulterated
with pitch.<a id='r2551' /><a href='#f2551' class='c014'><sup>[2551]</sup></a> In Judæa also was found the
singular stone called by Pliny and the Greek physicians
leucolithos, in magnitude about the size of
an acorn, of a milk-white colour and marked with
a number of parallel bands, regular as if produced
by the turning lathe. Reduced to powder it was
exhibited as a medicine.<a id='r2552' /><a href='#f2552' class='c014'><sup>[2552]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The articles of merchandise supplied to commerce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>by the peninsula of Arabia,<a id='r2553' /><a href='#f2553' class='c014'><sup>[2553]</sup></a> were rather curious and
valuable than numerous.<a id='r2554' /><a href='#f2554' class='c014'><sup>[2554]</sup></a> Of these one of the most
extraordinary was that white and transparent gem,
in search of which they went forth into the desert
at midnight, when the stone was discovered by its
brightness reflecting amid palm-trees and sand hillocks
the refulgence of the moon, whose several
phases it was supposed to imitate in form, being
circular at times and at times semicircular. For
this reason it obtained the name of aphroselenon
or moonstone.<a id='r2555' /><a href='#f2555' class='c014'><sup>[2555]</sup></a> From a belief in its hidden virtues
women wore it about their necks as an amulet
against enchantment. It was likewise suspended
upon trees to augment their bearing. Eagle-stones<a id='r2556' /><a href='#f2556' class='c014'><sup>[2556]</sup></a>
were also a production of Arabia, together with certain
fine white stones which when calcined were used
as a dentrifice.<a id='r2557' /><a href='#f2557' class='c014'><sup>[2557]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Hence too was obtained a beautiful diaphanous
marble resembling the phengites, which, when sawed
into thin laminæ, served instead of glass for window-panes.<a id='r2558' /><a href='#f2558' class='c014'><sup>[2558]</sup></a>
Near certain islands on the coast of Arabia,
in the Persian gulf, was a pearl-fishery which, though
inferior in value and celebrity to that of Serendib,
still furnished Greece and the whole western world
with a large quantity of pearls.<a id='r2559' /><a href='#f2559' class='c014'><sup>[2559]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The plains of the Arabian wastes have in all ages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>been covered at intervals with forests of palm-trees.
Dates, therefore, from the earliest times, have been
among the exports of the peninsula. The manner
of climbing the trees in the fruit season was much
the same in antiquity as at present. The person
about to ascend made with a cord a loop inclosing
both his own body and the tree, which warping up
as he mounted enabled him to rest at intervals.<a id='r2560' /><a href='#f2560' class='c014'><sup>[2560]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the soil, sandy and arid, exposed almost perpetually
to a burning sun, delights above all things
in the production of thorny shrubs and trees, whose
gum and resin, from the united virtues of the climate
and the earth, are nearly all fragrant and medicinal.<a id='r2561' /><a href='#f2561' class='c014'><sup>[2561]</sup></a>
Of these some are still in use, while others have
disappeared from commerce, or are known under
different names. Among the latter was the cancamon,
a strongly odoriferous gum used by physicians,
introduced into the manufacture of odoriferous
unguents, and mingled with myrtle and styrax for
perfuming apparel.<a id='r2562' /><a href='#f2562' class='c014'><sup>[2562]</sup></a> Among the former were the
ladanum,<a id='r2563' /><a href='#f2563' class='c014'><sup>[2563]</sup></a> the myrrh, and the frankincense,<a id='r2564' /><a href='#f2564' class='c014'><sup>[2564]</sup></a> of which
the ancient naturalists have left us an interesting
account. It was produced, they say, in the territory
of the Sabæeans about Mamali, Citibaina and
Adramytta, now Hadramaut. Both the frankincense
and the myrrh trees grew partly on the mountains,
partly on private grounds at their roots, where they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>were cultivated, while the others, apparently, were
left to the superintendence of nature. The favoured
ridges adorned by these aromatic plantations are
said to have been extremely lofty, covered with
woods and clad above with snow, while from their
slope and summits numerous streams poured down
to the plains.</p>

<p class='c001'>The tree<a id='r2565' /><a href='#f2565' class='c014'><sup>[2565]</sup></a> which produces this most precious gum
attains no great height, sometimes not above seven
or eight feet; but throws out exceedingly numerous
branches and expands itself in breadth. The foliage,
though more diminutive, resembles in form that of
the pear-tree, but its verdure approaches the light
colour of the rue. In smoothness the bark everywhere,
both on trunk and branches, resembles that
of the laurel. The myrrh-tree is still smaller, and
more like a shrub. Its stem clothed with a smooth
bark, and about the thickness of a man’s leg, is
extremely tough and twisted towards the root. In
character its foliage has at once been compared to
the elm and the scarlet oak,—rough, pointed, and
uneven, and armed at the edges with thorns.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of myrrh there were various kinds, deriving their
different qualities from the nature of the soil or
from the manner in which the gum was obtained
from its tree, some being thick and unctuous, and
abounding in that sweet oil called stactè,<a id='r2566' /><a href='#f2566' class='c014'><sup>[2566]</sup></a> while
other kinds were light, clean, and transparent. These
accounts appear to have been obtained from eye-witnesses.
Certain mariners, we are told, setting
sail from the gulf of Heroes, now Suez, and arriving
in the frankincense country, landed in search
of water.<a id='r2567' /><a href='#f2567' class='c014'><sup>[2567]</sup></a> During this excursion they advanced as
far as the mountains, where they observed the appearance
of the trees and the manner of collecting
the gum. Incisions, they related, were made in
the trunk and the branches, some large, as with
a hatchet, others smaller.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>From some of these the frankincense rained upon
the ground, while in other parts it issued forth more
slowly, thickening as it flowed. Mats of palm leaves
were by some proprietors spread on all sides under
the tree, which thus appeared to spring from a carpeted
floor, while others merely levelled the soil and
swept it.<a id='r2568' /><a href='#f2568' class='c014'><sup>[2568]</sup></a> The frankincense, however, which fell
upon the mats was more pure and pellucid than
the other, which necessarily attracted some particles
of earth. What remained sticking to the trees
was severed with a knife, on which account it
sometimes contained small splinters of bark. The
superior kinds were generally found in commerce
of a globular form, into which it was said to have
run at the first. In colour it was white, unctuous
when broken, and immediately kindled at the approach
of flame. That which was brought from
India in colour somewhat yellow and livid, was manufactured
into grains by art; for, having been
pressed into a mass, it was cut into small square
pieces which were cast into a vessel and shaken
until they assumed a round form.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same observer affirmed, that the whole of
this mountain tract was divided among the Sabæans,
who were the lords of that part of the country, and
distinguished for their justice, on which account the
trees required no watching. They were further informed,
that both the myrrh and the frankincense
when collected were conveyed on camels to the
Temple of the Sun, the holiest place in the country
of the Sabæans, and continually guarded by
armed men. When the precious merchandise had
been borne thither, each person piled his own property
in a separate heap, on the top of which placing
a tablet declaring its weight and value, they
committed it to the care of the temple wardens.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the merchants arrived they inspected the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>tablets, and if satisfied with the price took possession
of the merchandise, leaving the value in its
place. The transaction being concluded, the priest,
according to some authorities, appropriated one-third
of the proceeds to the service of the gods; but
others speak with more probability of a tenth,
which seems, everywhere in the ancient world, to
have been consecrated to the service of religion.
The remainder was kept for the owners until they
arrived to claim it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The frankincense produced by young trees was
of a pale white colour, but less fragrant than the
gum of older trees, which was of a deep yellow.
The former probably was what was called Amomites,
which possessing little consistence easily melted
like gum-mastic, by the touch of the hand.
On the way to Greece it was frequently adulterated
with fine resin and common gum; but the
imposture was easily detected because the gum refused
to burn, and the resin resolved itself into
smoke, whereas the frankincense yielded a clear flame.
In the opinion of many the best kind was brought
from Arabia, though in colour it was deemed inferior
to the produce of the neighbouring islands. Connected
with the natural history of this production,
a circumstance is related which seems to have been
viewed by the ancients in the light of a prodigy.
In the grounds of a temple near Sardis<a id='r2569' /><a href='#f2569' class='c014'><sup>[2569]</sup></a> a <a id='corr399.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='species,'>species</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_399.28'><ins class='correction' title='species,'>species</ins></a></span>
of frankincense tree sprang forth spontaneously from
the earth, having a smooth bark like the laurel, and
shedding a gum resembling that of the Arabian
perfume.</p>

<p class='c001'>The numerous groves of frankincense trees which
covered the hills and valleys of southern Arabia,
constantly distilling their sweet gums, are said to
have impregnated the whole atmosphere with their
delicious fragrance, which, when the breezes prevailed
off the land, was wafted out many leagues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>from the shore. To this Milton alludes in the
well known lines:<a id='r2570' /><a href='#f2570' class='c014'><sup>[2570]</sup></a></p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Nor is this to be regarded as a mere poetical
figure of speech. Sir Thomas Herbert,<a id='r2571' /><a href='#f2571' class='c014'><sup>[2571]</sup></a> sailing up
the Persian gulf on his return from the East Indies,
found the atmosphere of the ocean perfumed
by the spirits issuing from the flowers of Arabia,
and observes, that mariners while yet out of sight
of land have discovered where they were by the
prevalence of these odoriferous gales. The same
effect has been observed in other parts of the
world. Pernetty<a id='r2572' /><a href='#f2572' class='c014'><sup>[2572]</sup></a> relates, that, on approaching the
island of St. Catharine on the Brazil coast, the
fragrance of its aromatic herbs and flowers may be
detected at more than three leagues. In dark
nights, or hazy weather, the dogs on board a ship
will smell the land at considerable distance, so as
in such cases to serve instead of a telescope.</p>

<p class='c001'>From a district of Arabia Felix, as well as from
Petra in Idumæa, was obtained that gum in globules,
called bdellion,<a id='r2573' /><a href='#f2573' class='c014'><sup>[2573]</sup></a> alluded to in the second
chapter of Genesis,—“and the gold of that land
is good; there is bdellion and the onyx stone.”
Arabia likewise exported preserved ginger,<a id='r2574' /><a href='#f2574' class='c014'><sup>[2574]</sup></a> though
not apparently till a comparatively late period. In
the country itself they seasoned their drinks and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>potages with the green leaves, as the Greeks usually
did with rue.<a id='r2575' /><a href='#f2575' class='c014'><sup>[2575]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the other exports of Arabia was cassia<a id='r2576' /><a href='#f2576' class='c014'><sup>[2576]</sup></a>
of various qualities, together with cinnamon,<a id='r2577' /><a href='#f2577' class='c014'><sup>[2577]</sup></a> respecting
the gathering of which the following mythological
narrative was delivered to strangers. The
trees producing this sweet and fragrant bark grew,
they said, in a certain valley, inhabited by innumerable
serpents, to guard themselves against which,
those who came to gather cinnamon had their feet
and hands carefully covered with boots and gloves.</p>

<p class='c001'>The spice being collected was divided into three
parts, of which one belonged to the Sun. To prevent
the god from being defrauded of his due
share, lots were drawn, and the portion which thus
fell to him was piled up in a heap upon the sand.
The Arabs then departed, but, having reached a certain
distance, usually turned back, when they were
sure to behold the portion of the sun on fire, and
sending up its flames and smoke towards the god
to whom it appertained.<a id='r2578' /><a href='#f2578' class='c014'><sup>[2578]</sup></a> It is clear from this,
that the natives of the Arabian peninsula had already
begun to collect materials for “The Thousand
and One Nights.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another fragrant production of this country was
the wood of aloes,<a id='r2579' /><a href='#f2579' class='c014'><sup>[2579]</sup></a> which seems to have found
its way, in great quantities, to the west, together
with capers,<a id='r2580' /><a href='#f2580' class='c014'><sup>[2580]</sup></a> costus,<a id='r2581' /><a href='#f2581' class='c014'><sup>[2581]</sup></a> carpobalsamum,<a id='r2582' /><a href='#f2582' class='c014'><sup>[2582]</sup></a> cardamums,<a id='r2583' /><a href='#f2583' class='c014'><sup>[2583]</sup></a>

and the odoriferous rush;<a id='r2588' /><a href='#f2588' class='c014'><sup>[2588]</sup></a> the scink, of which we
have already made frequent mention, was likewise
obtained from Arabia.<a id='r2589' /><a href='#f2589' class='c014'><sup>[2589]</sup></a> Broth made of the flesh of
this animal is taken as an aphrodisiac by the Arabs,
and its flesh dried and reduced to powder was still
exported in the time of Hazelquist,<a id='r2590' /><a href='#f2590' class='c014'><sup>[2590]</sup></a> through Alexandria
to Venice and Marseilles.</p>

<p class='c001'>The island of Tylos, now Bahrein,<a id='r2591' /><a href='#f2591' class='c014'><sup>[2591]</sup></a> on the coast
of Lahsa, in the Persian gulf, is said to have furnished
excellent timber for ship-building, which in
the water would last upwards of two hundred
years.<a id='r2592' /><a href='#f2592' class='c014'><sup>[2592]</sup></a> Could this have been a species of teak?<a id='r2593' /><a href='#f2593' class='c014'><sup>[2593]</sup></a>
Here, also, as well as on the continent grew the
cotton tree in great abundance, from which the natives
manufactured coarse calicoes and fine muslins.
Another production of the island was a tree bearing
inodorous flowers resembling the white violet,
though four times as large. Here, too, was found
another tree with leaves like the rose, which being
fully expanded at noon contracted as the day advanced,
and closed entirely at night, when the tree,
by the natives, was said to sleep. The same thing,
by the people of India, is at present predicated of
the Averrhoa Carambola.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>The fertility of this island may be compared with
that of Thasos. Here grew in abundance the date
palm, the vine, the olive, the apple, and most kinds
of nuts, with fig trees which never shed their foliage.
No value was set upon the moisture derived
from the clouds; on the contrary, when any showers
fell, the inhabitants were careful immediately afterwards
to irrigate their plantations, as if to wash
away the rain. With this they were, in fact, enabled
to dispense, on account of the number of fountains
and streams of water which there abounded.<a id='r2594' /><a href='#f2594' class='c014'><sup>[2594]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From Mesopotamia, Persia, Armenia, and the
adjacent countries, the Greeks obtained a number
of valuable commodities, of which far too meagre
an account has been left us by the ancients. Of
these the most curious, however, may be said to
have been the naphtha, or rock oil, which springs
forth spontaneously from the earth in several parts
of those regions lying between the Caspian and
the Persian gulf.<a id='r2595' /><a href='#f2595' class='c014'><sup>[2595]</sup></a> The most remarkable of their
oil springs was found of old near Ecbatana, now
Hamadan, where Alexander was smitten with astonishment
at beholding a torrent of flame ascending
perpetually out of the earth.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>This everlasting fire was supplied through subterraneous
channels with naphtha, which in the vicinity
welled forth from the soil and formed a small
lake. This naphtha, clear, when pure, as fine oil, is,
perhaps, the most inflammable substance known,
kindling by the invisible gases which surround it
considerably before it comes into actual contact with
fire. Several experiments illustrative of its qualities
were performed for the amusement of the son
of Philip. In the first place certain Persians sprinkled
with it the street leading to the royal quarters,
and then applying a torch to the earth at the
farther end of it, the flame ran along with the rapidity
of thought, so that in an instant the whole
street seemed to be converted into a channel of
fire.</p>

<p class='c001'>On another occasion one Athenophanes, a profligate
buffoon who had abandoned the sweets of
freedom at Athens to attend on the Macedonian
tyrant, being along with his master in the bath,
advised him in the true spirit of a courtier to make
a cruel experiment of the power of the naphtha on
a poor youth named Stephanos, of homely person
and comic expression of face, but gifted with a
magnificent voice, and who used apparently to divert
Alexander while bathing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Shall we try the force of this substance on
Stephanos? For, if it kindle and prove difficult
to be extinguished on him its powers may truly be
said to be altogether strange and irresistible!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The youth readily consented to encounter the
peril. As soon, however, as he had been anointed
with it and brought near a fire the naphtha<a id='r2596' /><a href='#f2596' class='c014'><sup>[2596]</sup></a> instantaneously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>kindled, and his whole body was
sheathed in flame to the extreme perplexity and
terror of Alexander. He would, in fact, have been
reduced to ashes had there not been at hand many
persons bearing vessels of cold water for the baths,
which pouring over him they with extreme difficulty
extinguished the flames. He, nevertheless,
felt severely the effect of his royal master’s inhuman
curiosity.<a id='r2597' /><a href='#f2597' class='c014'><sup>[2597]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Certain writers, desirous of giving an historical
explanation of the legends of the mythology, suppose
the golden crown and veil sent by Medea to
Creüsa, which utterly consumed her in the presence
of her family, to have been smeared with naphtha;<a id='r2598' /><a href='#f2598' class='c014'><sup>[2598]</sup></a>
for the flames burst not forth spontaneously from
the ornaments themselves, but a fire burning near,
they, by a subtle power, attracted its seeds and
were kindled invisibly.<a id='r2599' /><a href='#f2599' class='c014'><sup>[2599]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was believed by the ancients that the country
of Babylonia was pervaded throughout by veins
of fire, which maintained a perpetual inflammation in
the earth and produced towards the surface a species
of pulsation. For, according to them, grains
of barley being cast upon the soil would leap up
and rebound, for which, however, other causes might
be assigned. But the heat of the climate is undoubtedly
prodigious, and, to mitigate it, we are
told, the ancient inhabitants were accustomed to
sleep on skins filled with water. Harpalos, who was
made governor of the province by Alexander, laboured
to acclimate there the trees and plants
of Greece, and succeeded in everything excepting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>ivy which, delighting in a cold soil, could not be
reconciled to the “temper of that fiery mould.”<a id='r2600' /><a href='#f2600' class='c014'><sup>[2600]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There was obtained from Persia a gum of singularly
healing qualities, which on this account received
the name of sarcocolla,<a id='r2601' /><a href='#f2601' class='c014'><sup>[2601]</sup></a> or flesh-glue, as, also,
kermes,<a id='r2602' /><a href='#f2602' class='c014'><sup>[2602]</sup></a> cardamums,<a id='r2603' /><a href='#f2603' class='c014'><sup>[2603]</sup></a> pistachio nuts,<a id='r2604' /><a href='#f2604' class='c014'><sup>[2604]</sup></a> artichokes,<a id='r2605' /><a href='#f2605' class='c014'><sup>[2605]</sup></a>

likewise exported gold solder,<a id='r2609' /><a href='#f2609' class='c014'><sup>[2609]</sup></a> onyx shells,<a id='r2610' /><a href='#f2610' class='c014'><sup>[2610]</sup></a> whetstones,<a id='r2611' /><a href='#f2611' class='c014'><sup>[2611]</sup></a>
and jaspers,<a id='r2612' /><a href='#f2612' class='c014'><sup>[2612]</sup></a> one kind of which was intersected
with white veins. Amulets of this stone
were much used in incantations. From the province
of Bactriana emeralds of great beauty, but of small
size, were procured for the studding of costly cups
or goblets. They were found in a sandy and desert
tract of country, the one apparently which separates
Khorasan from Balkh and Khawaresmia during the
prevalence of the Etesian gales which, unsettling
and shifting the sand, kept constantly laid open
fresh spots which were, in many cases, strewed
with gems. The search for these emeralds, a hardy
and laborious undertaking, was performed by horsemen
who, by fleet riding, could scour the wilderness
in a brief space of time, bending their keen
glances hither and thither as they moved along.<a id='r2613' /><a href='#f2613' class='c014'><sup>[2613]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In a region beyond Bactria a species of corn was
found which must unquestionably have been maize,
since the grains are said to have been as large as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>olive stones,<a id='r2614' /><a href='#f2614' class='c014'><sup>[2614]</sup></a> and to maize only can we apply
Herodotus’s description of the wheat found in
Babylonia, the straw of which was encircled by
leaves four inches in diameter, and its return from
two to three hundredfold. Now, in wheat, I believe,
so prodigious an increase is all but impossible,
whereas a still greater return might be obtained
from the Indian corn. A lady whom I knew
at Thebes counted eighteen hundred grains in one
ear of Syrian maize which was, probably, not less
than nine inches in circumference; and from such
grain the return mentioned by Herodotus<a id='r2615' /><a href='#f2615' class='c014'><sup>[2615]</sup></a> is not
at all extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c001'>The millet and sesamum of Babylonia are likewise
mentioned, though it is probable that, owing
to the difficulty of carriage, it only exported small
quantities to be used as seed. Barn-door fowls were
introduced into Greece from Persia, and always continued
to be known by the name of the Median
birds.<a id='r2616' /><a href='#f2616' class='c014'><sup>[2616]</sup></a> Peaches, too, and various other kinds of
fruit, as we have already mentioned in the book
on Country Life, were brought to Greece from the
Persian empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>This country likewise exported the oil of white
violets used in the bath, and the odour of which
they enjoyed during their repasts;<a id='r2617' /><a href='#f2617' class='c014'><sup>[2617]</sup></a> shaggy winter
cloaks seem to have been obtained from northern
Persia, together with dyed leather,<a id='r2618' /><a href='#f2618' class='c014'><sup>[2618]</sup></a> resembling the
shagreen and marocco of present times, brought
partly from Babylonia, partly from Persia Proper,
which likewise supplied the world with carpets exquisitely
variegated with figures of animals.<a id='r2619' /><a href='#f2619' class='c014'><sup>[2619]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>The Persians also imported furs, but do not appear
to have exported them, the use of these
articles being little known to the Greeks.<a id='r2620' /><a href='#f2620' class='c014'><sup>[2620]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Respecting the commerce carried on with India
the notions of the ancients were confused, chiefly
because the various commodities passing through
other countries were often confounded with their
indigenous productions. We know, however, that
from this rich land came many of the spices and
precious stones in use among the Greeks,—as the
diamond, the ruby, the sapphire,<a id='r2621' /><a href='#f2621' class='c014'><sup>[2621]</sup></a> and the finest
kind of pearls,<a id='r2622' /><a href='#f2622' class='c014'><sup>[2622]</sup></a> the most fragrant spikenard,<a id='r2623' /><a href='#f2623' class='c014'><sup>[2623]</sup></a> with
costus,<a id='r2624' /><a href='#f2624' class='c014'><sup>[2624]</sup></a> and amomum,<a id='r2625' /><a href='#f2625' class='c014'><sup>[2625]</sup></a> and cinnamon,<a id='r2626' /><a href='#f2626' class='c014'><sup>[2626]</sup></a> and cassia,<a id='r2627' /><a href='#f2627' class='c014'><sup>[2627]</sup></a> and
odoriferous reeds.<a id='r2628' /><a href='#f2628' class='c014'><sup>[2628]</sup></a> Thence also was obtained a kind
of cyperos,<a id='r2629' /><a href='#f2629' class='c014'><sup>[2629]</sup></a> whose juice was bitter, and of yellow
colour, and appears to have been used for removing
hair from the skin.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>Another Indian export was the bark called narcapthon,<a id='r2630' /><a href='#f2630' class='c014'><sup>[2630]</sup></a>
which, together with wood of aloes obtained
from the same country, was used as a perfume.<a id='r2631' /><a href='#f2631' class='c014'><sup>[2631]</sup></a>
Black, white, and long pepper,<a id='r2632' /><a href='#f2632' class='c014'><sup>[2632]</sup></a> were likewise
among the productions of India, which found their
way to the west, together with sugar, the art of
manufacturing and refining which appears to have
been known to the Hindûs from the remotest antiquity.
The whiteness of the Indian sugar, as well
as that it was loafed may be inferred from a passage
of Dioscorides, who compares it to salt, and
says, that it broke easily beneath the tooth.<a id='r2633' /><a href='#f2633' class='c014'><sup>[2633]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There was in India, moreover, a kind of myrrh
produced from a thorny shrub, of which no exact
description is given.<a id='r2634' /><a href='#f2634' class='c014'><sup>[2634]</sup></a> But one of its most celebrated
productions was the spikenard, which is said
to have grown upon a mountain at the foot of
which flowed the Ganges. The malabathron,<a id='r2635' /><a href='#f2635' class='c014'><sup>[2635]</sup></a> another
export of the Indian peninsula, was from
the similarity of its odour by some of the ancients
confounded with the leaf of the spikenard, as it
appears to have been by the moderns with the
piper betel, or the Canella Silvestris Malabarica.
But from the description of Dioscorides, it is clearly
neither the one nor the other; for, while the betel
is a parasite cultivated on terra firma, like the vine
and the Canella Silvestris, the malabathron was, we
are told, an aquatic plant, floating on the surface
of lakes, or the waters of morasses, without the
slightest connexion with the soil beneath, like the
little lentil of the marshes: its leaves when gathered
were strung on a linen thread, and in that manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>hung up to dry, after which they were laid by
for exportation. Occasionally, during the heats of
summer, the malabathron lakes were dried up, upon
which the natives were accustomed to scatter heaps
of brushwood over their whole site and set them on
fire, so that the entire surface of the earth might
be burned, without which, it was supposed the plant
would no more appear. Among the uses of the
malabathron was the sweetening of the breath, which
was done by placing a leaf under the tongue. Thrown
into coffers or wardrobes it communicated a perfume
to raiment, and preserved it from the moth. The
uses to which the wood of aloes was put were in
some respects similar, as it was kept in the mouth
to sweeten the breath, and sprinkled, when reduced
to powder, over the body to repress perspiration.</p>

<p class='c001'>A coarse kind of bdellion,<a id='r2636' /><a href='#f2636' class='c014'><sup>[2636]</sup></a> and a species of lycion
were reckoned among the productions of India.<a id='r2637' /><a href='#f2637' class='c014'><sup>[2637]</sup></a>
From an island on the coast was obtained a precious
bark called macer,<a id='r2638' /><a href='#f2638' class='c014'><sup>[2638]</sup></a> of great medicinal virtue; aloes,
too, was thence exported in abundance. The artichoke<a id='r2639' /><a href='#f2639' class='c014'><sup>[2639]</sup></a>
was plentifully produced on the banks of
the Indus, as well as in the mountains of Hyrcania
and Khawaresmia. The substance denominated onyx
shell,<a id='r2640' /><a href='#f2640' class='c014'><sup>[2640]</sup></a> procured from a fish resembling the myrex,
was found in certain Indian marshes, where a species
of spikenard is said to have flourished. On
the drying up of the waters in the great heats of
summer, these shells were found strewed over the
soil, and exported for their odoriferous and medicinal
qualities. The great lizard, called the land
crocodile,<a id='r2641' /><a href='#f2641' class='c014'><sup>[2641]</sup></a> has likewise been enumerated among the
productions of India. Other Indian commodities
were fine muslins,<a id='r2642' /><a href='#f2642' class='c014'><sup>[2642]</sup></a> ivory, and tortoise shell,<a id='r2643' /><a href='#f2643' class='c014'><sup>[2643]</sup></a> from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>Taprobana,<a id='r2644' /><a href='#f2644' class='c014'><sup>[2644]</sup></a> a rich species of marble,<a id='r2645' /><a href='#f2645' class='c014'><sup>[2645]</sup></a> steel of the
finest quality,<a id='r2646' /><a href='#f2646' class='c014'><sup>[2646]</sup></a> peacocks,<a id='r2647' /><a href='#f2647' class='c014'><sup>[2647]</sup></a> and a large, beautiful breed
of white oxen.<a id='r2648' /><a href='#f2648' class='c014'><sup>[2648]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Two kinds of indigo, employed both in painting
and dyeing were exported from Hindùstân.<a id='r2649' /><a href='#f2649' class='c014'><sup>[2649]</sup></a> Of these
the one is said to have been a natural production
which exuded from certain canes and hardened in
the sun, the other was artificial, consisting of the
substance which adhered to the copper vessels wherein
artificers dyed blue. Having been scraped thence
it was supposed to be dried and introduced into commerce.
These accounts have already, by other authors,
been shown to be erroneous, but they prove
at least that indigo was in common use among the
ancients, though we understand nothing of the means
by which it was produced, or how it was cultivated.<a id='r2650' /><a href='#f2650' class='c014'><sup>[2650]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The cotton tree appears to have been grown in
India<a id='r2651' /><a href='#f2651' class='c014'><sup>[2651]</sup></a> from the remotest antiquity, where the natives
manufactured from it the finest fabrics, as calicoes,
and chintzes, and muslins, regarded even as
superior to the manufactures of Greece.<a id='r2652' /><a href='#f2652' class='c014'><sup>[2652]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another production of Eastern Asia, which was
imported into Greece much earlier than is generally
believed, was silk,<a id='r2653' /><a href='#f2653' class='c014'><sup>[2653]</sup></a> of the origin and natural history
of which they had but an imperfect and confused
knowledge. It was understood, however, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>be created by the labour of an insect with eight
feet, called ser, about twice the size of the largest
beetle. In other respects it was compared with the
spider which suspends its web from the boughs of
trees. These insects they kept in houses, the temperature
of which was regulated according to the
change of the seasons. The fine thread spun by
the ser was found twisted about its legs. They fed
them during four years upon the leaves of common
panic, but on the fifth, because they knew they
would live no longer, they gave them green reeds
to eat, which was the food in which the creature
most delighted. On this it fed so greedily, that it
burst itself, upon which store of fine thread was
found in its bowels.</p>

<p class='c001'>The country whence this substance was obtained
is said to have been a kind of delta, situated in
a deep recess of the Indian ocean, and inhabited
by a mixed race, half Indian and half Scythian. In
this account there is we see some truth, mingled
with a great deal of error. The greatest care is
still taken in China to regulate the temperature of
the houses in which the silkworms are bred, as well
as to remove them beyond the reach of all noises
and offensive smells.<a id='r2654' /><a href='#f2654' class='c014'><sup>[2654]</sup></a> With respect to the figure
and food of the insect Pausanias had been misinformed,
though he might have obtained more correct
knowledge by passing over into the island of
Ceos, where the silkworm had been found from time
immemorial.<a id='r2655' /><a href='#f2655' class='c014'><sup>[2655]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In later ages the merchandise of India, and central
Asia was chiefly conveyed to the countries on
the Mediterranean by way of Arabia and the Red
Sea, but at an earlier period it came wholly overland.
The exact course pursued by the caravans
in these remote times has not been accurately described
to us; but as the nature of the country has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>always remained unchanged, it is to be presumed,
that they pursued exactly the identical tracks which
they at present follow. Occasionally some few of
the commodities of Central Asia may have found
their way into Greece by the desert, north of the
Caspian, but the more common route lay through
Khawaresmia and Syria, whence they were distributed
to the rest of the western world by the Phœnicians.</p>

<p class='c001'>The produce of India was probably transported
across the Indus at Attock,<a id='r2656' /><a href='#f2656' class='c014'><sup>[2656]</sup></a> and from thence through
one of the nine passes into Persia, by way of Candahar
and Herat, after which the caravan fell into
the road leading to Susa,<a id='r2657' /><a href='#f2657' class='c014'><sup>[2657]</sup></a> Ecbatana, or Persepolis,
according as its destination was the northern or
southern part of Mesopotamia. Sometimes commerce
followed the course of rivers, down the Indus
for example, thence along the coast of Persia, and
up the Persian gulf and the Euphrates or the Red
Sea. On most of the roads mentioned there appear
to have existed in those ages caravanserais, as at
present, where merchants and travellers were accommodated
with lodging, water, and fuel, being expected
to carry along with them whatever provisions
they required. Into this part of the subject, however,
it is not my purpose to enter at any length,
since to investigate it thoroughly would require a
separate volume.</p>

from the circumstance of its
being covered with the plant
which furnishes the <em>kermes</em>,
a small berry about the size of
a pea split in two, and which
gives a dye between vermilion
and red, and is an article of considerable
trade, selling at from
a dollar to one dollar and a
half per pound in Fez, whilst
here, during the month of May,
which is the season for gathering
it, it can be procured
at from one bougou (1s. 4d.)
to one and a half per pound,
when bought from the Arabs:
but if the proper plan were
adopted, which is, to send a
party hired by the month, with
a superintendent to direct their
operations, it might be procured
at from eight-pence to

would form a most lucrative

<p class='c001'><a href='#r2477'>2477</a>. It appears to be perfectly
clear, notwithstanding the arguments
of Palmerius, (Exercitat.
in Auct. Græc. p. 17, sqq.,) that
the wool-bearing trees described
by Herodotus, (iii. 106, cf. ii.
86, vii. 181,) and Theophrastus
(Hist. Plant. iv. 7. 7,) were no
other than the perennial cotton
shrubs. Palmerius was led into
the mistake he has committed by
having been informed, that the
cotton was an annual plant,
whereas, as is now well known,
there are two species of cotton
shrub, the one annual, the other
perennial, and it was evidently
the latter that flourished in India
and the island of Tylos. Pollux,
who speaks distinctly of cotton,
relates, that it was produced in
Egypt. (Onomast. vii. 75.) Belon,
(Observat. ii. 6,) seems to
imagine that the ancient authors
above cited, speak of the silk
tree, which is found growing at
the present day on the banks of
the Nile, in Upper Egypt and
Nubia.</p>

elaborate account of the pearl-fishery
in the Persian gulf. This
traveller gives, from the traditions
of the natives, a fabulous
explanation of the origin of the
pearls, which is exceedingly fanciful
and poetical: “It is generally
believed that these pearls are
progenerated by the May dews,
during which month the oysters
rise up to the surface of the
waters, and opening themselves
receive a small quantity of dew,
which, being coagulated, afterwards
produces these pearls.
Certain it is, that, if these oysters
are opened before June, the
pearls are soft and pliable like
pitch.” Churchill’s Collection
of Voyages, vol. ii. p. 196.</p>

water actually found on the
island is brackish, while the sea
is thought by some to have gained
so far upon the land as to
cover certain springs which supplied
the ancient inhabitants with
excellent water. Even now, however,
the produce of these fountains
is not wholly lost though
doubtless deteriorated by the admixture
of sea-water. “There
are certain springs,” observes
Nieuhoff, “arising in the bottom
of the sea, at three fathoms and
a half deep. Near the city of
Manama, certain divers go early
in the morning in boats, about
three musket shots from the
land, and dive to the bottom
of the sea, fill their earthen or
leathern vessels with the water
that issues from the springs,
and so come up again and return
to the shore.” Churchill’s

Sir Thomas Herbert’s account of
the Persian naphtha is not exactly

“This naphtha,” says he, “is an

colour not unlike soft, white
clay; of quality hot and dry,
so as it is apt to inflame with
the sunbeams, or heat that
issues from fire, as was mirthfully
experimented upon one of
Alexander’s pages, who, being
anointed, with much ado escaped
burning.” Some Years’

  <h3 id='ch6.14' class='c012'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> FUNERAL CEREMONIES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Having now gone through the whole circle of
private life among the Hellenes, we shall consider
them in the hour of death, and during the ceremonies
with which dust was committed to dust.
From a great variety of causes, the dissolution of the
body was regarded by the pagans of antiquity with
less terror and apprehension than modern nations
experience. Their belief in the continuance of existence
was not perhaps more unshaken than that of
pious men in Christian countries, but the life to
come was contemplated as more nearly resembling
the present; and they imagined that, by the performance
of certain rites and ceremonies, and through
the favour of the gods in various ways obtained,
they might easily secure to themselves a blissful
immortality, which, according to their creed, was
denied to none but the incorrigibly flagitious. In
earlier times, moreover, before the birth of the sceptical
systems of philosophy, no chilling doubts had
been thrown on the doctrine of immortality. Ignorant
they might be of the Divine nature, of the
relations of man to his Creator, of the true duties,
obligations, and rules of life; but they were so fully
convinced of the existence of a race of superior
beings, that they might almost be said to feel its
truth as they did that of their own existence. These
beings they believed to be everlastingly occupied
with human, or rather with Hellenic, concerns; for it
seems evident that most of the gods were looked
upon more as the parents and guardians of the Grecian
race than as remote and general watchers over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>the whole universe. To pass out of life, therefore,
was but to pass out of the domains of one god into
those of another; to exchange the protection of the
celestial for that of the infernal Zeus. Everywhere
and on all occasions Gods were supposed to attend
their footsteps, but more especially at the moment
of their decease, when a cloud of heavenly messengers
hovered around them, some to accomplish the
separation between soul and body, others to lead and
protect the spirit in its descent to the subterranean
world, and others again to watch over its happiness
while there, sharing along with it the same dwelling-place,
and bearing the same relation to it as a monarch
does to his subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>Possessed firmly by persuasions of this kind, it is
little to be wondered at that the ancient Greek
experienced less reluctance to enter upon the domains
of the dead than is now too commonly felt.<a id='r2658' /><a href='#f2658' class='c014'><sup>[2658]</sup></a>
He had, besides, another motive to cheer his departure.
It was his firm expectation to be welcomed
on his entrance to the Elysian fields by his parents
or friends or companions, by all, in short, whom he
had loved in life, and who had preceded him to
that sacred and serene abode. Thinking and feeling
thus, death seemed scarcely death, but a mere shifting
of the scene or change of locality. It was but
falling asleep in one place to wake in another where
their happiness could know no change; where God
would wipe away tears from all eyes, and where there
should be no more trouble or sorrow or suffering
for ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>These, nevertheless, must be regarded as the habitual
convictions of the mind, which, however they
might influence the actions and resolutions of men,
could by no means stifle their feelings, or prevent
that sorrow and regret which must always be experienced
by persons about to be separated from those
they love. Hence the death-bed of the Greeks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>presented not a scene of stoical indifference. All
the tenderness and sympathy of which the human
heart is capable was usually awakened. The
friends, and more especially the women of the family,
crowded about the couch to press the dying hand,
and catch the last breath as it fluttered in broken
murmurs from the lips.<a id='r2659' /><a href='#f2659' class='c014'><sup>[2659]</sup></a> Most persons, when about
to bid an eternal adieu to the world, desired to lay
some command on their sorrowing friends, not as
an imperious task but as a labour of love, by performing
which they might be reminded of the departed.
Such commands as these the Grecian women
were most anxious to receive, that they might
treasure them up in their souls, and by pondering
on them incessantly, day and night, keep vividly alive
in their memory the idea of those who had once
been all in all to them. Nor when the spirit had
departed did they forsake the corpse, nor abandon it
to the care of menials. With their own hands they
closed the beloved eyes,<a id='r2660' /><a href='#f2660' class='c014'><sup>[2660]</sup></a> and tied up the mouth
from which words of kindness or comfort were never
more to sound. Putting a severe restraint upon their
feelings, they straightened,<a id='r2661' /><a href='#f2661' class='c014'><sup>[2661]</sup></a> laved, anointed, and laid
out the corpse,<a id='r2662' /><a href='#f2662' class='c014'><sup>[2662]</sup></a> covered it with costly garments,<a id='r2663' /><a href='#f2663' class='c014'><sup>[2663]</sup></a>
and placed crowns of flowers upon its head: it was
then borne to the vestibule of the mansion and laid
with the feet towards the door,<a id='r2664' /><a href='#f2664' class='c014'><sup>[2664]</sup></a> to intimate that it
was about to proceed on its last journey, and take
up its abode in the house prepared for all living.
Vessels of lustral water<a id='r2665' /><a href='#f2665' class='c014'><sup>[2665]</sup></a> were then placed beside
it; that, being accounted unclean, all those who
passed in or out and might be supposed to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>reached by the effluvia which exhaled from the dead,
might sprinkle and purify themselves. Branches of
laurel and acanthus, with locks of hair, were suspended
over the doorway, each being a symbol speaking
to the imagination of that lively people. While
thus exposed the corpse was watched day and night
by its natural guardians, until the moment arrived
for bearing it forth to the funeral pile or the grave.
It was then laid in a coffin, generally of cedar or
cypress-wood,<a id='r2666' /><a href='#f2666' class='c014'><sup>[2666]</sup></a> which, being placed upon a bier,<a id='r2667' /><a href='#f2667' class='c014'><sup>[2667]</sup></a> was
borne away, the mourning friends and family attending.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Athens<a id='r2668' /><a href='#f2668' class='c014'><sup>[2668]</sup></a> this ceremony took place immediately
before day-break,<a id='r2669' /><a href='#f2669' class='c014'><sup>[2669]</sup></a> numerous individuals bearing the
mortuary torches, preceding the bier,<a id='r2670' /><a href='#f2670' class='c014'><sup>[2670]</sup></a> and lighting
up its melancholy way. The men next of kin
marched silently in the rear of the coffin to intimate
that they should shortly follow in the same
track, and the women who kept together in a body,<a id='r2671' /><a href='#f2671' class='c014'><sup>[2671]</sup></a>
closed the procession, weeping and lamenting as they
went. Stationed here and there in the crowd, were
certain funeral musicians playing airs solemn and
sad, but with an intermixture of enthusiastic notes,
upon Lydian or Phrygian flutes. Sometimes the
company was mounted in chariots or upon horses,
but when especial honour was intended to the dead,
everybody accompanied the hearse on foot. And
surely a group like this, moving along by night
through the narrow winding streets of Athens skirting
the rocks of the Acropolis, flitting across the
agora, between its silent booths and stately plane-trees,
and issuing forth through the city gates into
the sepulchral suburbs of the Cerameicos, where a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>forest of tombs stretched a considerable distance along
the said way, to deposit, as if by stealth, the dust
of a human being in the bosom of the earth, must
have exhibited a striking and a solemn spectacle;
more particularly if we suppose that, roused by the
mournful music, thousands of neighbours and fellow-citizens
hurried to their casements to behold
their countryman carried to his long home. Having
reached the destined spot, the body, if to be interred,
was laid in the grave with its face looking
towards the west.<a id='r2672' /><a href='#f2672' class='c014'><sup>[2672]</sup></a> The earth was then thrown
upon the coffin, and a monument, in most cases,
speedily erected over it. If by special desire of
the deceased, or for any other reason, cremation<a id='r2673' /><a href='#f2673' class='c014'><sup>[2673]</sup></a>
was preferred, they constructed a funeral pile of
unctuous and odoriferous woods upon which oil and
sweet unguents were commonly poured.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the summit of this the corpse was then placed,
and a torch having been applied to the pyre by
some near relation of the dead, the whole was reduced
to ashes. Before, however, the flames were
quite extinguished, custom required that a little
wine should be cast upon them, after which if any
bones of the dead remained unconsumed they were
carefully collected together with the ashes, and deposited
in an urn, which in Greece was usually
committed to the earth.<a id='r2674' /><a href='#f2674' class='c014'><sup>[2674]</sup></a> All the surviving relations
now returned mourning to their dwelling,
where, towards evening, a funeral feast was celebrated
in honour of the dead.<a id='r2675' /><a href='#f2675' class='c014'><sup>[2675]</sup></a> Twice during the
same month were sacred rites performed at the
tomb, and afterwards for ever on the anniversary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>of the deceased’s birth, as well as on a certain
day of the festival of Anthesteria, when unfading
flowers were strewed around, and heaps of crowns
and garlands suspended on the monument. The
outward tokens of the grief felt inwardly consisted
of black garments,<a id='r2676' /><a href='#f2676' class='c014'><sup>[2676]</sup></a> heads partially shorn and a sad
and neglected countenance.</p>

<p class='c001'>In nearly all parts of the world, the moment
death sets the impress of his seal on the human
clay it appears to acquire an awful and mysterious
sanctity, which none but the hardened and base
will consent to violate. Belonging to the grave,
its everlasting calm and silence seem already to
brood over it. It presents itself to our eyes like the
inhabitant of another world, and therefore though
voiceless it reveals to us, as it were, some particulars
respecting a state of being of which we know
nothing, but feel necessarily the most devouring
curiosity. Besides, when the deceased has been
dear to us in life, we regard his corpse as the
deserted mansion of a friend, as the tabernacle of
a soul scarcely different, though divided from our
own. On this account the ancient Greeks, a people
beyond most others pious, imaginative, and affectionate,
cultivated with peculiar care the duties
which we owe the dead. Ancient writers abound
with illustrations of this truth. When the Thebans,
after the defeat of Adrastos and Polyneices refused
burial to the fallen Argives, it was considered by
the Athenians a sufficient cause for declaring war
against Bœotia. It was not pretended that the invaders
had been engaged in an honourable war; but
having expiated their transgression by death, their remains
had passed under the protection of the infernal
deities, and to refuse them the rites of sepulture
was not so much to insult them as Pluto, and the
other gods of Hades, whose subjects they were now
become. The unburied corpse was, moreover, a polluting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>object which defiled the temples of the celestial
divinities, and therefore they also were interested
in watching over the rights of the dead; for dogs
and beasts of prey might carry their flesh or bones into
the fanes, and thus render them unclean. And this
sentiment, which constituted one of the most amiable
parts of the Greek character, tended likewise to confer
imperishable beauty and interest on the Hellenic
land. For, the numerous tombs, public and private,<a id='r2677' /><a href='#f2677' class='c014'><sup>[2677]</sup></a>
which clustered over and hallowed its surface, addressed
themselves still more powerfully to the
heart than to the eye. Everywhere the devotion
of the people clung around them. They were at
once the creations and the monuments of human
love, of public gratitude, of holy reverence for intellect
and virtue.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same observation, indeed, applies universally.
The pyramid, the solitary barrow, rising like a hillock
on the plains of Asia, the crowded cemetery,
the vast suites of sepulchres excavated beneath the
surface of the earth, each and all of these must
ever be regarded by men of sensibility and unsophisticated
understanding as so many unequivocal
tokens of the ineradicable goodness of human nature.
Examples without number might be adduced in illustration.
When a North American chief was
urged to cede to the European invaders the hunting-ground
of his tribe, he stated his objection in
these words: “How can we abandon the country
in which all our ancestors lie interred? Shall we
say to the bones of our forefathers, ‘Arise, and
go along with us into a strange land’?” In many
countries a more absorbing interest attaches to the
abodes of the dead than to the habitations of the
living. Who, for example, can traverse, without
the most profound emotion, those suites of subterraneous
palaces at Thebes denominated the Tombs
of the Kings? You seem, in these vast painted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>halls and dusky passages, to hold actual converse
with death. The grave unfolds its mysteries on
all sides around. The imagination is kindled and
takes a colour from the unearthly creations presented
to it, and you return with something like
reluctance to the glare and turmoil and busy passions
of the world. Among the Greeks, as we have
observed, the dead were invested with a sanctity
which all good men esteemed inviolable, and this
persuasion acquired additional force from the belief,
that, though separated, the spirit and the body
were not yet wholly independent of each other.
For, upon the treatment experienced by its remains
the state of the soul was in some measure regulated
in the realms below. If these received the rites
of interment, the spirit was allowed freely to traverse
that stream, dusky and inviolable, which surrounded
the realm of Hades. If not, the ghost, cold
and desolate, wandered along its hither shore during
the space of a hundred years; after which,
the laws of Orcus relented, and permitted it to
taste of happiness amid the groves of Asphodel,<a id='r2678' /><a href='#f2678' class='c014'><sup>[2678]</sup></a>
and those blissful bowers where poets and sages
devoted the circle of eternity to the culture and
pure delights of wisdom. From this persuasion, the
ghosts of persons denied the rites of sepulture<a id='r2679' /><a href='#f2679' class='c014'><sup>[2679]</sup></a> are
represented by the poets hovering around their
corses and presenting themselves in visions to their
surviving friends, requesting them to sever, by the
performance of their obsequies, the sad links which
still bound them to their dwellings of clay. Thus
Homer introduces Elpenor<a id='r2680' /><a href='#f2680' class='c014'><sup>[2680]</sup></a> conjuring Odysseus to
perform this last sad office for his remains. Often
when, by shipwreck or murder, the body was cast
on some solitary shore, or abandoned in the recesses
of some forest or mountain, inhumation was solely
dependent on chance. But if fortune conducted any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>stranger to the spot, it was considered incumbent
on him to discharge, in one way or another, the
ties of humanity to the dead. But, because he
might not be able to dig a grave or consume the
body on a funeral pile, it was reckoned sufficient to
cast three handfuls of dust upon the corpse, of
which one, at least, was to be sprinkled on the
head. Thus we find, in Horace,<a id='r2681' /><a href='#f2681' class='c014'><sup>[2681]</sup></a> the manes of the
Pythagorean philosopher, Archytas, intreating the
mariners, who had found his body on the beach,
to honour it with this rite:</p>

      <div class='line'>Cast thrice the dust, then hasten hence away.</div>

<p class='c016'>In order the more certainly to secure this act of humanity
from the passer-by<a id='r2682' /><a href='#f2682' class='c014'><sup>[2682]</sup></a> persons about to perish by
shipwreck were accustomed to tie around their body
gold, or jewels, or whatever else they possessed of
value, that it might defray the expenses of their interment,
and reward him who undertook it.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were, however, certain classes of men who,
by their open or secret wickedness, were supposed
to be placed beyond the expansive circle of human
sympathy, on whom it would have been criminal
to lavish sepulchral rites. These were, in the first
place, individuals struck by lightning, whom the
gods were believed thus to have destroyed,<a id='r2683' /><a href='#f2683' class='c014'><sup>[2683]</sup></a> from
a knowledge of their guilt, though hidden from all
other eyes. Corpses of this kind were usually covered
with earth where they lay without the slightest
ceremony, unless they happened to have fallen in
some public temple, or agora, or highway, under
which circumstances a hook was fastened to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>body, by which it was dragged and cast into some
pit. On other occasions the carcase was hedged
round and so left. Men guilty of suicide were
likewise denied the honours of burial, but more especially
those of the funeral pile. Their carcases
were simply thrown into a pit and covered over, to
prevent their becoming a nuisance to the living.
Villains who committed sacrilege, and traitors to
their country were not suffered to enjoy in death
the protection of those divinities whom they had
outraged, or the refuge of a grave in a country which
they had basely betrayed to the enemy.<a id='r2684' /><a href='#f2684' class='c014'><sup>[2684]</sup></a> Their dishonoured
bones were cast beyond the borders, nor
was it permitted any citizen to celebrate for them
the rites of burial. Thus King Pausanias, who
sought to enslave his country to the Persians, was
treated by the Lacedæmonians, Aristocrates by the
Arcadians, and Phocion by the people of Athens,<a id='r2685' /><a href='#f2685' class='c014'><sup>[2685]</sup></a>
though in this last case, perhaps, through error
and misapprehension. The last and worst class
were tyrants<a id='r2686' /><a href='#f2686' class='c014'><sup>[2686]</sup></a> equally objects of hatred to gods and
men, who usually when overcome by their subjects
expiated their guilt by the most unheard-of torments,
while, in the nether world, the worst pangs
of Tartarus were reserved for them. To deposit in the
bosom of the earth the carcases of malefactors so heinous
would of itself have been esteemed a crime of a
very deep dye. The remains were, therefore, trodden
under foot, subjected to every other species of indignity,
and then cast forth to be devoured by the
dogs and vultures. Nay, if we may interpret the
expression of Plato literally, the punishment of men
who even aimed at tyranny in a free state and failed
in the attempt was tremendous: they were tortured
and mutilated, had their eyes burned out, suffered
every imaginable insult and injury, and at last crucified,
or covered with pitch and burned alive: their
wives and children suffered the same punishment—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>innocent being confounded with the guilty.
To protect their ashes from insults such as the
above, the kings of Egypt who erected the pyramids
and were in character fierce and tyrannical, are supposed
by Herodotus not to have entrusted their
bones to the keeping of those structures. A wild
story is also related of Periander of Corinth,<a id='r2687' /><a href='#f2687' class='c014'><sup>[2687]</sup></a> who,
conscious of having ruled his countrymen with a rod
of iron, dreaded the effects of their resentment on
his corpse. Effectually to conceal the place of his
interment he is said to have directed two of his
satellites to go forth at night on a certain road and
kill and bury clandestinely the first man they should
meet. Four others were despatched to execute the
same vengeance upon them, and another crowd of
assassins received orders to exterminate and bury
these four. Periander, then old and infirm, presented
himself to the first murderers, was slain and
buried, and the place, from the sudden death of
all who might have known it, thus remained undiscovered
for ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most opposed to these were those honourable
citizens<a id='r2688' /><a href='#f2688' class='c014'><sup>[2688]</sup></a> who fell for their country in defence of
its liberty and laws, whom their fellow-citizens followed
to the tomb with every conceivable mark of
public gratitude and honour, and whose names future
generations were taught to reverence like those of
gods. In some sense, indeed, they were actually
deified. Rites and ceremonies and sacrifices were
performed annually in their honour, and by their
great and heroic spirits future generations swore as
by the most ancient inhabitant of Olympos. Sometimes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>as on the plain of Marathon, the remains of
the warriors were collected together, and with holy
rites enclosed in one common barrow, calculated by
its dimensions to be co-lasting with the world. On
other occasions their remains were brought to the
city and buried there. Thus, at the outbreak of the
Peloponnesian war, the first citizens who fell received
the distinguished honours of a public funeral.
Their remains were enclosed in coffins of cedar,
and laid in open hearses, drawn by horses carefully
caparisoned, and covered with garlands, were conveyed
to the Cerameicos, the whole population of the
state attending. When they had been there committed
to the earth, Pericles, the greatest statesman
and orator of those times, ascended a bema, and, in
words which must thrill through the hearts of all
posterity, pronounced on them an encomium to merit
which most brave men would cheerfully have bartered
life.</p>

<p class='c001'>The modes of sepulture prevalent in different ages
among the Hellenes were various in like manner
as the monuments erected in honour of the dead.
Originally, when public security was weak, men
buried their dead within the walls of their own
dwellings, where alone, perhaps, they could hope to
preserve their resting-place inviolable. In accordance
with this pious feeling a law was anciently enacted
at Thebes in Bœotia, that whoever built himself
a house should construct within or adjoining
it a repository for the dead. But when states grew
up and acquired strength, and the shadow of their
protection fell around far and wide, it was found
practicable to consult the public health without infringement
of the reverence due to the divinities
of Hades, and the habitations of the departed were
erected, like a sacred circle, round the city walls.</p>

<p class='c001'>Afterwards, in the period of Grecian decrepitude,
the cities once more opened their gates to their
ancestors, and permitted that they should share with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>themselves the imperfect security which was the lot
of all in those degenerate times.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much has been said on the custom which obtained
among both Greeks and Romans, of extending their
cemeteries along the high roads leading countrywards
from the city gates.<a id='r2689' /><a href='#f2689' class='c014'><sup>[2689]</sup></a> Their object appears to have
been twofold: first, by erecting the monuments of
deceased friends in sight of all persons entering or
quitting the city to render their memory more enduring;
secondly, that by witnessing the honours
paid to the brave and good of past times, those who
came after them might be incited to imitate their
example.</p>

<p class='c001'>But no place was deemed too sacred to admit
the remains of good or great men, which were
occasionally enshrined within the precincts of temples
or sacred groves.<a id='r2690' /><a href='#f2690' class='c014'><sup>[2690]</sup></a> Thus the children of Medea
were buried in the temple of Hera, Œdipos found
a tomb in the grove of the Eumenides at Colonos,<a id='r2691' /><a href='#f2691' class='c014'><sup>[2691]</sup></a>
and Hesiod, whose body comes floating to the shore
while the Samians are engaged in the performance
of sacred rites, is honoured with a funeral in the
grove of the Nemean Zeus.<a id='r2692' /><a href='#f2692' class='c014'><sup>[2692]</sup></a> Euchides, likewise,
who died in consequence of the extraordinary celerity
with which he performed the journey to and
from Delphi in quest of the sacred fire, was interred
by the Platæans in the temple of Artemis Euclea.
Among the Spartans the practice commonly prevailed
of burying around sacred edifices; nor did
they, even in later times, banish their dead to the
suburbs; the design of this departure from the
fashion elsewhere established being to eradicate from
the mind of youth all apprehensions of spectres,
and reluctance to move, whether by night or by
day, among tombs and graves. In all parts of
Greece, families, at least when above the humblest
in rank, possessed each their burial grounds, whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>standing wholly apart in orchards or gardens,<a id='r2693' /><a href='#f2693' class='c014'><sup>[2693]</sup></a> or
forming so many separate portions of the general
cemetery.<a id='r2694' /><a href='#f2694' class='c014'><sup>[2694]</sup></a> But nowhere does so great stress appear
to have been laid on this distinction of families in
death as at Sparta, as may be inferred from the
account of that battle in which, animated by the
songs of Tyrtæos, the youth bound about their right
arms tablets inscribed with their own names and
those of their fathers, that so, should they all perish,
their friends might be able to select from among
the heaps of slaughter the bodies of their relatives,
and inter them with scarlet mantles and olive-leaves
in the cemeteries of their clans.<a id='r2695' /><a href='#f2695' class='c014'><sup>[2695]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Frequently the remains of distinguished persons
were consigned to the dust in picturesque situations,
remote from towns and the habitations of men, where
chapels were in many instances erected to their memory.
Thus we find the heroon of Androcrates<a id='r2696' /><a href='#f2696' class='c014'><sup>[2696]</sup></a>
shrouded in thick copses and trees amid the spurs
of Mount Cithæron, on the western extremity of
the field of battle of Platæa. In a situation very
similar stood the tomb and temple of Amphiaraos,
and the heroon of Drimacos in the island of Chios.
Among the Cretans, likewise, the sepulchre of Zeus
occupied the lofty summit of a mountain, where its
ruins are still pointed out to the traveller. A poetical
sentiment, moreover, has, in modern times, given
rise to the persuasion that the ruins of Themistocles’
tomb are still to be seen amid that line of ancient
sepulchres which run along the surf-beaten rocks near
the point of Cape Halimos. On this supposition is
based the well-known passage of Byron:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><a id='corr427.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='No'>“No</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_427.33'><ins class='correction' title='No'>“No</ins></a></span> breath of air to break the wave</div>
      <div class='line'>That rolls below the Athenian’s grave;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>That tomb which, gleaming o’er the cliff,</div>
      <div class='line'>Just greets the homeward-veering skiff,</div>
      <div class='line'>High o’er the land he saved in vain:—</div>
      <div class='line'>When shall such hero live again?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>But the learning of Colonel Leake has clearly shown,
that the monument of this illustrious statesman
stood within the horns of the great port of Aphrodisium.
In the city of Magnesia, where he died,
his tomb stood in the agora, which was customary
when extraordinary honour was designed the dead.<a id='r2697' /><a href='#f2697' class='c014'><sup>[2697]</sup></a>
Thus the monument of Timoleon,<a id='r2698' /><a href='#f2698' class='c014'><sup>[2698]</sup></a> surrounded by
porticoes and other public buildings, was erected in
the agora of Syracuse; and that of Harmodios and
Aristogeiton occupied the same place in the city of
Athens, where, in more ancient times, the tombs
of distinguished personages were hewn out in the
face of the cliffs, lined with marble, and otherwise
sumptuously adorned. Solon, however, sought to
repress the luxury of cemeteries<a id='r2699' /><a href='#f2699' class='c014'><sup>[2699]</sup></a> by ordaining that
no tomb should have an arched roof, or require more
labour than could be performed by ten men in three
days. But this law, in all probability, was never
strictly observed; for the Cimonian sepulchres, still
seen high amid the rocks overlooking the hollow
valley which divides the Areopagos from the Pnyx,
seem to have been of dimensions too spacious to
have been hewn out within the legal term.<a id='r2700' /><a href='#f2700' class='c014'><sup>[2700]</sup></a> Afterwards,
moreover, mortuary monuments of extraordinary
magnificence were erected at Athens, as that,
for example, of the hetaira Pythonicè. But it was
in barbarous countries that funereal structures exhibited
the greatest splendour, which reached possibly
its acmè in the tomb of Mausolos, king of
Caria, an edifice consisting of a pyramid erected on
a square basis, adorned on all sides with sculptured
figures in relief, and surmounted by a chariot drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>by four horses. The tomb of the mistress of Gyges,
though for materials inferior, probably exceeded in
dimensions this seventh wonder of the world. It was
erected, too, as a memorial of affection; for, when
the woman who, during her life, had ruled both him
and his kingdom, had been removed from earth,
that shepherd king collected together, we are told,
the whole of his subjects, and threw up so vast a
barrow over her remains, that, in whatever part of
his realm he might be, within Mount Tmolos, he
might enjoy the melancholy pleasure of beholding
her grave.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the structure of their tombs, as well as their
mode of interment, the various nations of antiquity
observed each a different style. Thus, in the purification
of Delos, the monuments of the Carians were
easily distinguished from those of the Greeks by the
manner in which their remains were deposited in
the grave. Certain sepulchral mounds, found in Peloponnesos,
were distinguished by some characteristic
features from those of the natives, and denominated
the Tombs of the Phrygians; and the burying
places of certain foreigners on whom the Greeks
bestowed the name of Amazons, exhibited as long
as they endured some distinctive marks<a id='r2701' /><a href='#f2701' class='c014'><sup>[2701]</sup></a> by which
they were known to cover the ashes of some barbarous
people. Over the tomb of Hippolyta, indeed,
a pillar was erected in the Grecian manner; but
at Chalcis, where there was an Amazonium, the
structure would appear to have exhibited some peculiar
features, as well as the tomb of these warlike
ladies, which was shown in the Megaris, between the
agora and a spot named Rhus, in the form of a
lozenge,<a id='r2702' /><a href='#f2702' class='c014'><sup>[2702]</sup></a> resembling their shields. Similar in shape,
likewise, were probably the Amazonian monuments
found near Scotussa in Thessaly, as well as those on
the banks of the rivulet Hermodon, in the neighbourhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>of Cheronæa.<a id='r2703' /><a href='#f2703' class='c014'><sup>[2703]</sup></a> On the plains of Troy the Amazon
Myrinna reposed under a vast barrow.<a id='r2704' /><a href='#f2704' class='c014'><sup>[2704]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The structures thus erected in honour of the dead
might have proved more durable but for the practice
common among the ancients, of interring jewels, gold,
precious vases,<a id='r2705' /><a href='#f2705' class='c014'><sup>[2705]</sup></a> and other treasures with the corpse,
which afterwards roused the cupidity of profligate
men, and tempted them to rifle the last houses of
their forefathers; for it is one of the most odious
and debasing features of civilisation, at certain stages
of it, that death is habitually desecrated, and the
grave ceases to be a refuge. Thus the tombs of the
Macedonian kings were plundered by the Gauls<a id='r2706' /><a href='#f2706' class='c014'><sup>[2706]</sup></a> in
the alliance of Pyrrhos. Again, the colony of Roman
freedmen sent to raise Corinth from its ashes, discovering
by chance that the catacombs contained
bronze and fictile vases of great beauty, rifled the whole
cemetery, and filled Rome with the spoils, which were
denominated Necrocorinthia. Even the obolos<a id='r2707' /><a href='#f2707' class='c014'><sup>[2707]</sup></a> placed
beneath the tongue, and the simple ornaments of the
humbler dead, proved sufficient to excite the avarice
of a certain class of robbers, denominated from their
practices tomb-spoilers.<a id='r2708' /><a href='#f2708' class='c014'><sup>[2708]</sup></a> When, however, the dust
of the departed has reposed in its cerements for
many ages, to disturb and plunder it becomes the
pursuit of learned men, and is regarded as a branch
of the science of antiquities. Thus the sepulchres
of the Egyptian kings have been spoiled and polluted
by travellers, who have burned by thousands
the wooden gods of the Pharaohs in their kitchens,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>sawed off the faces of pillars, dragged forth bodies
and coffins from their last hiding-place in order to
pilfer the golden ornaments suspended around the
necks of the dead. In Etruria, too, the same scientific
havoc has been carried on, and the museums
of Europe have been enriched by what was once a
capital offence. Even in our own country, barrows
have been habitually opened, and the bones of our
ancestors dislodged from their homes. Very curious
relics of antiquity, however, have thus been brought
to light. Similar tumuli in the East, denominated
topes, have been examined in Affghanistân. Beneath
the centre is usually a well, in which the ancient
remains, consisting of metallic vases, small cylinders
of gold, rings, jewels, and gold pins, appear to be
found.<a id='r2709' /><a href='#f2709' class='c014'><sup>[2709]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It was customary among the Greeks, not only
while their grief was yet new, but habitually for
many years, to visit the graves of the dead, to suspend
garlands and crowns and fillets of wool upon
their head-stones, or possibly, as is still the custom
in Burgundy, to place wreaths or other ornaments of
pure wool upon the grave itself,<a id='r2710' /><a href='#f2710' class='c014'><sup>[2710]</sup></a> and to protect them
by a trellis-work of willow boughs. Hither, too,
were brought baskets full of all fair and fragrant
flowers, more particularly roses, myrtles, amaranths,<a id='r2711' /><a href='#f2711' class='c014'><sup>[2711]</sup></a>
and lilies, to be strewed upon the beloved spot.
Sometimes graves were covered by a netting of wild
thyme,<a id='r2712' /><a href='#f2712' class='c014'><sup>[2712]</sup></a> which, like those characters that are ennobled
by affliction, yielded forth a delicious perfume
beneath the foot of the mourner. In cool and shady
spots, graves were sometimes adorned with the small
everlasting,<a id='r2713' /><a href='#f2713' class='c014'><sup>[2713]</sup></a> and the white flower called pothos.<a id='r2714' /><a href='#f2714' class='c014'><sup>[2714]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>Public cemeteries were likewise, in many places, beautified
by trees, selected in some cases for their thick
foliage and spreading form, as the elm; in others,
for their graceful shape and evergreen leaf, as the
poplar and the cypress. Other trees, also, whether
planted by the hand of man or springing up spontaneously,
covered the walks or spots of green sward
found in the cemeteries of Greece, supplying in abundance
that sombre shade into which grief loves to
retire, and where the sepulchral plants chiefly delight
to grow.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such spots so shaded, so verdant, and full of
fragrance, so consecrated to silence and repose, probably
first suggested the idea of the Elysian Fields
or Islands of the Blessed, which the poets of Greece
assigned to be the abode of happy souls. At first
perhaps the ghosts were believed to dwell in the
cemeteries, retiring by day to the depths of the
tombs and issuing forth during the dark and tranquil
hours of night to enjoy, by the light of the
moon or the stars, the sight of the world they had
partially quitted. From this notion flowed all the
modifications observable in the internal structure of
tombs. First, care was taken that the earth should
not press heavily on the corpse, somewhere within
the dimensions of which the ghost was supposed<a id='r2715' /><a href='#f2715' class='c014'><sup>[2715]</sup></a>
habitually to reside. Sentiments not greatly dissimilar
still survive among ourselves. I once remember
to have read on the gravestone of a little
girl standing near the stile by which you enter the
shady churchyard of Newport, in Monmouthshire,
the following epitaph, in which this idea is clearly
embodied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here a pretty baby lies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sung asleep with lullabies;</div>
      <div class='line'>Pray be silent, and not stir</div>
      <div class='line'>The easy earth that covers her.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>Secondly spacious and elegant chambers were frequently
constructed for the spirit’s use, where food
was likewise placed, and lamps were kindled which,
furnished with wicks of amianthos<a id='r2716' /><a href='#f2716' class='c014'><sup>[2716]</sup></a> and supplied with
inexhaustible fountains of oil, were believed to burn
on everlastingly. A similar notion leads many Mohammedan
nations to turn a small arch in the stone
basement of their tombs to accommodate the ghost
with free ingress and egress. Connected also with
this article in the creed of the ancients<a id='r2717' /><a href='#f2717' class='c014'><sup>[2717]</sup></a> was the
opinion, that spirits might often be seen gliding in
shadowy shapes among the tombs, which may be regarded
as a notion almost co-extensive with humanity
itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>In their modes of sepulture the barbarous nations<a id='r2718' /><a href='#f2718' class='c014'><sup>[2718]</sup></a>
of the ancient world differed widely from each other
and from the Greeks. The Syrians, Egyptians, and
even Persians, wholly eschewing the funeral pile,
buried their dead, having first embalmed them with
various conservative and aromatic substances, as myrrh
and aloes, and cedar-gum,<a id='r2719' /><a href='#f2719' class='c014'><sup>[2719]</sup></a> and honey, and salt, and
wax, and asphaltus, and resin, mingled with perfumes
and precious unguents. Among the Pythagoreans,
who adopted foreign rites in preference to those of
their country, it was customary to wrap the dead
in leaves of myrtle, poplar, and aloes, and thus to
commit them to the earth. The Albani put money
into the coffins with the corpse; the Taxilli, the
Brahmins, and the Thracians, like the modern Parsees,
exposed the bodies of their relations to be
devoured by vultures; the Barchæi, a people inhabiting
the borders of the Black Sea, followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>the customs of these nations in the case of such of
their countrymen as fell in war; but when they happened
to be so effeminate as to die peaceably in
their beds, they were condemned to the flames.
Dogs and carnivorous birds constituted the sepulchres
of the Parthians, Magians, Hyrcanians, and
other savage nations, who, however, were careful
to inter the bones which were left undevoured.
Among these philosophical people no thought was
more habitual than that of death, since men walked
daily beside their graves; for persons of condition,
who could afford to be luxurious in matters of this
kind, fed and pampered huge dogs for the express
purpose of being devoured by them after death,
such mode of interment being among them esteemed
the most honourable. The Essedones, the Calantii,
the Massagetæ, the Derbices, and the Hybernians,
on this point very strongly resembled in taste and
habits the Battas of Sumatra, the custom among
them having been to honour their parents and friends
with a far superior sepulchre to that of the foregoing
people, since they ate them themselves. It is remarked,
however, in the case of the Essedones, that
the skulls were carefully cleansed, gilded, and laid
by, to be produced on their solemn annual festivals.
The Derbices somewhat improved upon the method
of their neighbours; for, when their old people were
found to live too long, they hastened the approach of
death in the case of the men, by slaughtering them
like victims, and in that of the old women, by strangling
<a id='corr434.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='them'>them.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_434.32'><ins class='correction' title='them'>them.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Among the Hyperboreans the practice was, when
old people lived so long as to be thought troublesome,
to give them a farewell feast, and then, having
crowned their brows with chaplets, to pitch them
over steep cliffs into the sea. The Caspians adopted
a different method of bringing down the population
to a level with the means of subsistence; for, when
their parents and friends exceeded the age of seventy,
they either exposed them in remote and desolate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>places, as infants in many countries were, or shut
them up in huts to perish of hunger and thirst. The
mode of disposing of the dead adopted by one of
the Scythian nations was, to bind their corpses
to the trunks of trees, where they remained a long
time, congealed in the midst of ice and snow: to have
interred them in the earth they would have regarded
as a crime. Not greatly dissimilar was the Phrygian
mode, according to which the dead were placed upright
on ranges of stones fifteen feet high. A large
cemetery of this kind, having many ranges of rude
columns, each with its corpse or skeleton, viewed
by the dubious light of the moon, with flights of
ravens or vultures preying upon the bodies recently
set up, must have presented a terrific spectacle. The
Nasamones, a people of northern Africa, buried their
dead in a sitting posture, which, as I am informed
by General Miller, is still the custom among the
Araucanian Indians, who, binding the corpse in the
necessary posture with cords, excavate for it a grave
beneath their own beds. In some parts of the world,
as in Thrace, for example, and India, persons greatly
advanced in years, more especially such as were distinguished
for the cultivation of wisdom frequently
ascended voluntarily the funeral pile, like the Yoghee
Calanos, and Perigrinos who affected the airs of
a philosopher, terminated their existence with composure,
or even an appearance of gaiety in the
flames. A certain tribe said to have inhabited
the coast of the Red Sea, beyond the Æthiopians
and the Arabs, interred their friends in the sand,
within high-water mark, so that their graves should
constantly be overflowed by the surge. The Æthiopians
either cast the bodies of the deceased into the
Nile, or enclosed them in glass coffins, through which
the mouldering form might ever be contemplated.
In some parts of Upper Nubia a similar practice
still prevails; for the corpse being laid on the
sand, a wall of loose rocks is built up around it,
and secured with a slab atop. Through numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>apertures in the sides, of dimensions to admit light
but exclude the jackals, the skeleton may easily be
seen.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to a tradition preserved by Ælian,<a id='r2720' /><a href='#f2720' class='c014'><sup>[2720]</sup></a> Belos
was interred in a glass coffin, which, when Xerxes
caused his tomb to be opened, was found nearly
filled with oil, wherein the body lay floating. Beside
it stood a small column, on which was this
<a id='corr436.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='incription'>inscription</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_436.9'><ins class='correction' title='incription'>inscription</ins></a></span>, “Woe to him who having broken into
this sepulchre shall fail to fill my coffin.” At this
Xerxes was troubled, and immediately gave orders
that oil should be poured into the sarcophagus, but
to no purpose; for, though they made the attempt
once and again, it rose no nearer to the brim than
before. Conceiving that some grievous calamity was
impending over him, the king at length desisted,
and quitted the monument in the deepest dejection.
He shortly afterwards, adds the historian, undertook
his unhappy expedition into Greece, at the conclusion
of which, flying back to his own country, he
was there assassinated, as believed, by his own son.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Pœonians cast their dead into marshy pools;
the Ichthyophagi into the sea. Very different was
the custom of the Troglodytæ, who, tying their
corpses neck and heels with the twigs of some flexible
shrub, in this manner carried them forth, and
raising over them heaps of stones, as the Phoceans
did over Laïos and his servants, fixed, with laughter
and merriment, the horns of goats upon the tumulus.
Similar tombs exist at this day in Affghanistân,
in which are stuck sticks bearing wreaths and shreds
of cloth, together with tusks of the moufflon, the
ibex, and markhur.<a id='r2721' /><a href='#f2721' class='c014'><sup>[2721]</sup></a> In China, at the annual festival
in honour of the dead, the sepulchres are decorated
with streamers of red and white paper. Dead
bodies, in the Balearic isles, were jointed, cut up,
and stowed in urns on which huge piles of rock
were thrown. The Panebi, a people of Libya, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>a custom resembling in part that of the Essedones:
on burying the bodies of their kings they gilded their
skulls, and suspended them in their temples as ornaments.
The Sindi, a people of Scythia, doubtless
a branch of the Ichthyophagi, used to bury in the
graves of their warriors a small fish for every enemy
he had slain in battle, which must, doubtless, if they
were a brave people, have rendered their cemeteries
anything but odoriferous.<a id='r2722' /><a href='#f2722' class='c014'><sup>[2722]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From the enumeration of these fantastic and barbarous
rites we may perceive how striking was the
contrast between the manners of the Hellenes and
those of most other ancient nations. At one time,
however, a practice, little inferior in atrocity to those
above described, is said to have prevailed in the
island of Ceos,<a id='r2723' /><a href='#f2723' class='c014'><sup>[2723]</sup></a> where men on reaching sixty years
of age were constrained to drink hemlock or opium,
in order to economise the means of subsistence. But
this law, if it ever existed, must be thrown back
to very remote times, it being wholly inconsistent
with even the smallest advances of civilisation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ceremonies and symbols by which among the
Hellenes sorrow was expressed for the loss of friends
were numerous and significant. In the first place,
all tokens of pleasure and enjoyment were suppressed,
that affliction might seem to have extinguished every
spark that might thereafter have kindled joy. From
wine and sumptuous viands and whatever else brings
gratification to the mind at ease, they abstained as
though wholly unworthy to be honoured with even
the semblance of a capacity to mitigate their sorrow
for the departed. They banished all instruments
of music which happened to be in the house,
to intimate that they thenceforward renounced the
delights derivable from sweet sounds.<a id='r2724' /><a href='#f2724' class='c014'><sup>[2724]</sup></a> The same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>practice precisely prevailed among the Arabs under
the Kalifat. Thus “Haroon-er-Raschid, wept, we are
told, over Shemselnihar, and, before he left the
room, ordered all the musical instruments to be
broken.” They excluded the light from their chambers,
and retired to sob and lament in gloomy recesses,
as different as possible from the spots which
in the company of the beloved and lost object they
were accustomed to frequent. They neglected the
care of their persons, suffered in some places the
hair and beard to grow, or disfigured themselves by
cutting off a portion of their locks, casting ashes
on their heads, and wrapping themselves in coarse
and black apparel.<a id='r2725' /><a href='#f2725' class='c014'><sup>[2725]</sup></a> In consequence we find, that the
very manes<a id='r2726' /><a href='#f2726' class='c014'><sup>[2726]</sup></a> of their mules and horses were shorn.
Alexander, during the paroxysm of his grief for the
loss of Hephæstion,<a id='r2727' /><a href='#f2727' class='c014'><sup>[2727]</sup></a> even demolished the battlements
of cities, and, exaggerating the cruelty and
barbarism of remoter ages, crucified the physician
who had attended the youth, prohibited all music
in his camp, and undertaking an expedition against
certain tribes hitherto unsubdued, offered up whole
hecatombs to the manes of his minion.<a id='r2728' /><a href='#f2728' class='c014'><sup>[2728]</sup></a> The mourning
of the Lacedæmonians on the death of their kings
partook largely of the spirit of barbarism. As soon
as the event occurred, horsemen were despatched to
make it known throughout the Lacedæmonian territories,
while crowds of women paraded up and down
the city, beating or sounding kettle-drums. From
every family two persons, one of either sex, were
then selected, who were compelled under grievous
penalties to smear and disfigure themselves.<a id='r2729' /><a href='#f2729' class='c014'><sup>[2729]</sup></a> In
fact, assembling in great numbers, Spartans, Laconians,
and Helots, together with their wives, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>beat their foreheads and uttered strange howlings,
ever and anon affirming, amid their well-acted grief,
that the last king was the best. When the prince
happened to fall in battle, his effigy was borne
home on a bier sumptuously adorned, and to this
the same honour was paid as to the real corpse.
During the ten days immediately succeeding the
funeral no public business was transacted. For private
individuals, the Lacedæmonians scarcely mourned
at all, their system of ethics requiring them to suppress
every more tender feeling of the heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ceremonies designed to perpetuate the memory
of brave men can scarcely perhaps be regarded
as envious, but the glory which was like the Shekina
on their land, appeared to purify and ennoble
their descendants by inflaming them with the love
of country and liberty. Grecian manners abounded
with rites of this kind, but none seem more worthy
of commemoration than those observed annually by
the Platæans, in honour of the warriors who fell
around their city. It is well-known that the Greeks
regarded the spirits of good men of former ages as
guardian genii, to whom belonged religious veneration
amounting perhaps to worship. Their gods, in truth,
were in many cases colonists from earth, which can
surprise no one who observes, that among them the
principle of life was deified, and this, derived from
gods to mortals, resided for a time on earth, and then,
by continuing to move on in the circle, returned to
the heavens from which it sprang. They seem to
have regarded the earth as a sort of nursery-ground
in which the seeds of divinity were sown, to be afterwards
transplanted and bloom elsewhere. But among
the offspring of earth none appeared to them so nearly
akin to deity as those in whom courage and energy
shone preëminently, who loved passionately the soil
from which they sprang, and who sought cheerfully
in its breast a refuge from dishonour. Hence the
apotheosis and adoration of the brave; hence the Platæan
ceremonies, which, down even to Roman times,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>inspired the youth of Greece with admiration for
their ancestors, and called to their mind those glorious
days when their country teemed with freemen ready
at any moment to shed their blood for the institutions
and the land which those institutions alone
rendered holy.<a id='r2730' /><a href='#f2730' class='c014'><sup>[2730]</sup></a> These anniversary rites were celebrated
on the sixteenth day of the month Maimacterion,
the Alalcomenios of the Bœotians. The
procession moved forth from the city in the grey
of the morning, having at its head a trumpeter sounding
the signal of battle. Numerous chariots followed,
filled with myrtle-branches, and wreaths, and
garlands, succeeded by a black bull. Vessels of wine,
and jars of milk, and vases of oil and odoriferous
essences were borne next by a number of free youths,
no slave being permitted to take part in these solemnities
performed in honour of men who had died
for liberty. Last in the procession came the archon,
habited in a scarlet robe and armed with a sword,
though on all other occasions he was forbidden the
touch of steel, and went clad in white. In his hand
he bore a water-jar taken from the Hall of Archives.
In this he drew water from a fountain, and
having laved therewith the pillars which surmounted
the tombs, he perfumed them with the essences:
next slaying the bull at the altar, and addressing
his prayers to Zeus and the Chthonian Hermes, he
invoked to partake of the funeral repast and the
streams of blood, the spirits of those valiant men
who had fallen for their country. Then, filling a
goblet with wine and pouring it forth in libations,
he concluded with these words: “I drink to the
warriors who died for the liberties of Greece.”<a id='r2731' /><a href='#f2731' class='c014'><sup>[2731]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The printer employed the cursive forms of beta (ϐ) and theta (ϑ),
sometimes in the same passage with the standard β and θ. These have
been replaced with the standard forms.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some place names appear with slight spelling variations.  In the
interest of text searches, these have been modified to the most
frequently used version.  Compound words sometimes appear with or
without a hyphen, e.g., ‘corn-chandler’ / ‘cornchandler’. Where
hyphenation occurs on a line break, the hyphen is retained only
if there is a clear preference elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c001'>Punctation errors and inconsistencies in the footnote and
index apparatus have been corrected with no further mention
here.</p>

<p class='c001'>Index entries refer to topics in all three volumes of this text.</p>

<p class='c001'>Footnotes are gathered at the end of each chapter, and references
in the text are linked to them. The footnote references in the
Index were also updated to their new values.</p>

<div class='htmlonly'>

<p class='c001'>Links are also provided for convenient nagivation to the relevant
volumes.  We suggest opening those links in a new window.</p>

<p class='c001'>Index entries in Greek sometimes do not include diacritical marks.
These have been changed to match the referenced text, to facilitate

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
